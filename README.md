# Punctuation Style Guide

## Ampersands (&)
Use ampersand within titles when citing multiple versions, such as "Windows 7 & 8" or when you are specifically referring to the symbol on the user interface.

## Colons
Use a colon to precede a bulleted or numbered list.

**Example:** Follow the instructions below to retrieve data from a flat file:

1. Item one
2. Item two
Commas in Lists and Compound Sentences
Use serial commas to separate items in a list.

**Correct:** The information includes name, date, time, and GMT offset.
**Incorrect:** The information includes name, date, time and GMT offset.

In compound sentences, it is not always necessary to place a comma before the conjunction. If the two phrases that compose the compound sentence are brief, you can omit the comma. If one or both phrases are complex, use the comma.

## Ellipses
Do not use ellipses except to indicate omitted code. When you must use them, type three periods with no spaces in between them and no spaces preceding or following the ellipses. In the code blocks, place the ellipses on a separate line.

## Emphasis
Use the following guidelines to add emphasis to words, phrases, and sentences.

### Italics
Use italics to emphasize a word, but do so sparingly. Use italics when introducing a new term or when naming other documents.

### Quotation marks
When using quotation marks for emphasis, use "double quotation marks." Do not use 'single quotes'.

### Exclamation Points
Avoid using exclamation points. 

## Hyphenation
Do not hyphenate at line breaks.

- Hyphenate two or more words that modify a noun if confusion might result; for
example, "read-only memory."
- Hyphenate word/numeric two word modifiers, for example, "8-point font."
- Avoid suspended compound adjectives; for example, "You can use any combination of upper- and lowercase letters in a password." Spell out "uppercase" and "lowercase."

## Parentheses
Do not use parentheses in titles. If a title uses an acronym, spell it out unless it is internationally known, such as IBM. You can use parenthesis to define an acronym in text. Avoid using parenthesis in text to define a parenthetical phrase, instead use commas. 

## Punctuation in Bulleted Lists
Use the following guidelines for bulleted lists:

- Capitalize the first word of each bulleted item.
- Most bulleted lists are not full sentences and do not require periods. If one item has more than one sentence and requires a period, all items in the bulleted list get a period at the end.
- Numbered lists always get a period at the end of the sentence.

## Slashes
Do not use slashes except for technical terms.

## Spaces after Periods
There is no need to put two spaces after a period, colon, or question mark. The two-space rule comes from a legacy of printing presses and typewriters, which used letters of the same width. To help readers see when a new sentence was starting, two spaces were inserted. Computers use proportional fonts and the extra space is no longer needed.

## Quotation Marks with Commas and Periods
When a sentence ends with closing quotation marks, include the punctuation at the end of a sentence inside the quotation marks.

**Correct:** For more details, see "Streaming XML Input."

**Incorrect:** For more details, see "Streaming XML Input".

Place commas inside the quotation marks.
