        <p class="p">Report Designer has several features to help you easily align your report elements. All can be found in the <strong class="ph b">View</strong>  menu.</p>
        <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Grids</strong>  show a graph-paper-like grid on the report canvas. This can make it easier to evenly space elements by counting the exact number of hash marks between them. Grids can also make it easier to line up elements,
          but you may find it easier to rely on guides instead.</p>
        <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Guides</strong>  are markers you create by clicking on the rulers on the top and left of the report canvas. Once you have guides in place, it's easier to align report elements vertically and/or horizontally. To turn off guides,
          go to the <strong class="ph b">Guides</strong>  submenu in the <strong class="ph b">View</strong>  menu, then un-check the <strong class="ph b">Show Guides</strong>  item. You can remove individual guides by right-clicking them on the ruler, then
          selecting <strong class="ph b">Delete</strong>  from the context menu.</p>
        <p class="p">Perhaps the most useful alignment feature in Report Designer is <strong class="ph b">Element Alignment Hints</strong> . When you enable this option, each report element's outer borders will extend to the edges of the canvas, allowing you to easily
          line up multiple elements.</p>
        <p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Snap to Elements</strong>  feature will add a kind of magnetism to elements so that they are easier to align with adjacent elements.</p>
        <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  If elements are not horizontally aligned with column borders, the affected columns may be merged into one in the report output.</div>
