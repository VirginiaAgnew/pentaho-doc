          <p class="p">Sometimes report data can be difficult to read from left to right, especially if there isn't much space between rows. Report Designer has a row banding property that allows you to add alternately colored backgrounds to each row. Follow the process
            below to implement row banding.</p>

        <div class="section result">Row banding is now implemented for each distinct rendered line in your Details band. Row banding makes it easier to read reports, but if you need to go one step further, you can override it with conditional formatting.</div>
