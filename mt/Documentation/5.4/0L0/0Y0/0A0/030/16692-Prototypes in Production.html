        <p class="p">Once you're ready to test your OLAP schema on a wider scale, use the <strong class="ph b">Publish</strong>  button above the Model pane in the Model perspective, and use it to connect to your test or development BA Server.</p>
        <p class="p">You can continue to refine your schema if you like, but it must be republished each time you want to redeploy it.</p>
        <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  Agile BI is for <strong class="ph b">prototyping only</strong> . It is extremely useful for developing OLAP schemas that meet the needs of business analytics developers, business users, and database administrators.
          However, <strong class="ph b">it should not be used for production</strong> . Rather, once your Agile BI schema has been refined, you will have to either hand-edit it in Schema Workbench to optimize it for performance, or completely re-implement
          the entire model with Schema Workbench.</div>
