        <p class="p">Pentaho Data Integration (PDI) provides you with tools that include ETL, modeling, and visualization in one unified environment &mdash; the Spoon interface. This integrated environment allows you to work in close cooperation with business users
          to build business intelligence solutions more quickly and efficiently.</p>
        <div class="body conbody">
          <p class="p">When you are working in Spoon you can <em class="ph i">change perspectives</em>, or switch from designing ETL jobs and transformations to modeling your data, and visualizing it. As users provide you with feedback about how the data is presented
            to them, you can quickly make iterative changes to your data directly in Spoon by changing perspectives. The ability to quickly respond to feedback and to collaborate with business users is part of the Pentaho Agile BI initiative.</p>
          <p class="p">From within Spoon you can change perspectives using the <span class="ph uicontrol">Perspective</span>  toolbar located in the upper-right corner.</p>
          <p class="p">The perspectives in PDI enable you to focus how you work with different aspects of data.</p>
