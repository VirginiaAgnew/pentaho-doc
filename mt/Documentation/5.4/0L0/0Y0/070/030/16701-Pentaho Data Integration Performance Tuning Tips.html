                <td class="entry" headers="d107551e41 " valign="top" width="67.98196166854565%">Rewriting JavaScript to use a format that is not compatible with previous versions is, in most instances, easy to do and makes scripts easier to work with and to read. By default, old JavaScript programs run in compatibility mode. That
                  means that the step will process like it did in a previous version. You may see a small performance drop because of the overload associated with forcing compatibility. If you want make use of the new architecture, disable compatibility
                  mode and change the code as shown below:
                  <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li"><code class="ph codeph">intField.getInteger() > intField</code></li>
                    <li class="li"><code class="ph codeph">numberField.getNumber() > numberField</code></li>
                    <li class="li"><code class="ph codeph">dateField.getDate() > dateField</code></li>
                    <li class="li"><code class="ph codeph">bigNumberField.getBigNumber() > bigNumberField</code></li>
                    <li class="li">and so on...</li>
                  </ul> Instead of Java methods, use the built-in library. Notice that the resulting program code is more intuitive. For example :
                  <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li">checking for null is now: <code class="ph codeph">field.isNull() > field==null</code></li>
                    <li class="li">Converting string to date: <code class="ph codeph">field.Clone().str2dat() > str2date(field)</code></li>
                    <li class="li">and so on...</li>
                  </ul> If you convert your code as shown above, you may get significant performance benefits.
                  <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  It is no longer possible to modify data in-place using the value methods. This was a design decision to ensure that no data with the wrong type would end up in the output rows of the step. Instead
                    of modifying fields in-place, create new fields using the table at the bottom of the Modified JavaScript transformation.</div>

                    <li class="li">Network latencies and launching multiple copies of a step can reduce average latency. If you have a low network latency of say 5ms and you need to do a round trip to the database, the maximum performance you get is 200 (x5) rows per
                      second, even if the database is running smoothly. You can try to reduce the round trips with caching, but if not, you can try to run multiple copies. Example: a database lookup or table output</li>

The principle behind lazy conversion that it delays data conversion in hopes that it isn't
                  necessary (reading from a file and writing it back comes to mind). Beyond helping with data conversion, lazy conversion also helps to keep the data in &quot;binary&quot; storage form. This, in turn, helps the internal Kettle engine to
                  perform faster data serialization (sort, clustering, and so on). The Lazy Conversion option is available in the &quot;CSV Input&quot; and &quot;Fixed input&quot; text file reading steps.</td>
