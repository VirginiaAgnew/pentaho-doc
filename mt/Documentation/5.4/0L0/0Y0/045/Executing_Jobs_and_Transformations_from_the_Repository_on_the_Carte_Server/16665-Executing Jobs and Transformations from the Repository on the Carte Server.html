        <p class="p">To execute a job or transformation remotely on a Carte server, you first need to copy the local <span class="ph filepath">repositories.xml</span>  from the user's <span class="ph filepath">.kettle</span>  directory to the Carte server's <span class="ph filepath">$HOME/.kettle</span>           directory. The Carte service also looks for the <span class="ph filepath">repositories.xml</span>  file in the directory from which Carte was started.</p>
        <p class="p">For more information about locating or changing the <span class="ph filepath">.kettle</span>  home directory, see
