        <p class="p">When you select an aggregate, the Pentaho Aggregation Designer pulls information from the schema file to display its dimensions and levels. You can modify any aggregate the Pentaho Aggregation Designer recommends, customizing it for your needs.
          You can also create an aggregate from scratch and delete aggregates you do not want.</p>

          <div id="section_1" class="mt-page-section"><span id="Impact_summary"></span> 
            <h2 class="editable">Impact summary</h2>
            <p class="p">The impact summary in the lower right pane provides you with information on the estimated impact for creating all of the currently selected aggregates. This summary includes the number of aggregate tables that will be created, the estimated
              number of rows contained in those tables, and the estimated amount of space it will occupy on the hard drive. The impact summary is automatically updated as you select and deselect aggregates from the list of proposed aggregates.</p>

            <h2 class="editable">Cost/benefit chart</h2>
            <p class="p">The Cost/Benefit chart provides a high-level comparison of the benefit of all currently selected aggregates relative to their estimated cost. The benefit scale represents the relative number of queries that can be fulfilled by an aggregate
              table versus having to be retrieved from the base fact table. The cost scale is an indicator of the impact in terms of number of tables and disk space needed to create the selected aggregate recommendations.</p>

          <div id="section_3" class="mt-page-section"><span id="Saving_your_design"></span> 
            <h2 class="editable">Saving your design</h2>
            <p class="p">The Pentaho Aggregation Designer allows you to save all aggregate-related data (custom- or advisor-created) in your workspace at any time. Saving ensures that all of the data (your designs) in the workspace is retained; you are saving the
              state of your workspace as an XML file in a location you specify. To save, go to the <strong class="ph b">File</strong>  menu and click <strong class="ph b">Save As</strong> . To open a saved file, go to the <strong class="ph b">File</strong>               menu and click <strong class="ph b">Open</strong>, then navigate to the design you previously saved.</p>
