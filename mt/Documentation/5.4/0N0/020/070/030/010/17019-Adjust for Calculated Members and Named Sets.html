        <p class="p">If your Mondrian schema defines calculated members or named sets that reference MDX members without the dimension prefix, then you must set <strong class="ph b">mondrian.olap.elements.NeedDimensionPrefix</strong>  to <strong class="ph b">false</strong>           in your <strong class="ph b">mondrian.properties</strong>  file. Under all other conditions you would want to set this property to <strong class="ph b">true</strong>  because it increases Mondrian performance, as well as the readability of the
          schema XML file.</p>
