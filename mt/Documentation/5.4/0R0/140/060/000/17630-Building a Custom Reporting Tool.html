        <p class="p">The examples in this section have covered simple scenarios that don't involve a high degree of user interactivity. It's easy to imagine how far you can expand the example code, even to the point of building your own client tools. On a slightly
          smaller scale, you could build a report-generation program that merely takes some parameters from a user, then silently emails the report to designated recipients via the Java mail component. You could also design a reporting daemon or service
          that listens for incoming requests and outputs reports to a Web server.</p>
        <p class="p">Pentaho Report Designer is built on the Pentaho Reporting engine, as is the interactive reporting functionality built into the Pentaho User Console in the BI Platform. If you need a graphical report creation tool, it would be easier to modify
          Report Designer than it would be to rewrite it from scratch. For Web-based interactive reporting, you will have an easier time embedding the entire BI Platform than trying to isolate and embed just the interactive component.</p>
