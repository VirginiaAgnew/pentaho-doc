          <p class="p">The term big data applies to very large, complex, or dynamic datasets that need to be stored and managed over a long time. To derive benefits from big data, you need the ability to access, process, and analyze data as it is being created. However,
            the size and structure of big data makes it very inefficient to maintain and process it using traditional relational databases.</p>
          <p class="p">Big data solutions re-engineer the components of traditional databases&mdash;data storage, retrieval, query, processing&mdash;and massively scales them.</p>

          <p class="p">Pentaho increases speed-of-thought analysis against even the largest of big data stores by focusing on the features that deliver performance.</p>
          <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li">
              <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Instant access</strong> &mdash;Pentaho provides visual tools to make it easy to define the sets of data that are important to you for interactive analysis. These data sets and associated analytics can be easily shared
                with others, and as new business questions arise, new views of data can be defined for interactive analysis.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li">
              <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">High performance platform</strong> &mdash;Pentaho is built on a modern, lightweight, high performance platform. This platform fully leverages 64-bit, multi-core processors and large memory spaces to efficiently leverage
                the power of contemporary hardware.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li">
              <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Extreme-scale, in-memory caching</strong> &mdash;Pentaho is unique in leveraging external data grid technologies, such as Infinispan and Memcached to load vast amounts of data into memory so that it is instantly available
                for speed-of-thought analysis.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li">
              <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Federated data integration</strong> &mdash;Data can be extracted from multiple sources, including big data and traditional data stores, integrated together and then flowed directly into reports, without needing an enterprise
                data warehouse or data mart.</p>
