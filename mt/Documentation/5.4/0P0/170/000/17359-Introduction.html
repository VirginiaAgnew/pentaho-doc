        have encountered in the past or are anticipated to encounter in the future. Troubleshoot BA Server Issues is designed to address customers, partners, consultants, and internal Pentaho employees who are already familiar with the installation, configuration,
        and operation of Business Analytics, and only need to consult the documentation to solve a problem.</p>
