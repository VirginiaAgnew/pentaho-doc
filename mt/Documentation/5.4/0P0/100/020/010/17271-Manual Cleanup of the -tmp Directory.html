        <p class="p">Every time you generate content on the BA Server, temporary files are created on the local file system in the <span class="ph filepath">/pentaho-solutions/system/tmp/</span>  directory. In some cases, the BA Server may not properly purge that temporary
          content, leaving behind orphaned artifacts that can slowly build up and reduce performance on the volume that contains the pentaho-solutions directory. One way to address this is to mount the /tmp directory on a separate volume, thereby siphoning
          off all disk thrash associated with creating new content. However, you will still have to perform a manual garbage collection procedure on this directory on a regular basis. You can accomplish this via a script that runs through your system
          scheduler; it should be safe to delete any content files in this directory that are more than a week old.</p>
