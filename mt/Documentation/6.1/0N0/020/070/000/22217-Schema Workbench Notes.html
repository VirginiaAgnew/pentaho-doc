        <p class="p">Before you start using Schema Workbench, you should be aware of the following points:</p>
        <ul class="ul">
          <li class="li">You start Schema Workbench by executing the <span class="ph filepath">/pentaho/design-tools/schema-workbench/workbench</span>  script. On Linux and OS X, this is a <strong class="ph b">.sh</strong>  file; on Windows it's <strong class="ph b">.bat</strong> .</li>
          <li class="li">You must be familiar with your physical data model before you use Schema Workbench. If you don't know which are your fact tables and how your dimensions relate to them, you will not be able to make significant progress in developing a Mondrian
            schema.</li>
          <li class="li">When you make a change to any field in Schema Workbench, the change will not be applied until you click out of that field such that it loses the cursor focus.</li>
          <li class="li">Schema Workbench is designed to accommodate multiple sub-windows. By default they are arranged in a cascading fashion. However, you may find more value in a tiled format, especially if you put the JDBC Explorer window next to your Schema window
            so that you can see the database structure at a glance. Simply resize and move the sub-windows until they are in agreeable positions.</li>
