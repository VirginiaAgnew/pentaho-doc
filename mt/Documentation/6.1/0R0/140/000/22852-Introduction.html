      <p class="p">The Pentaho Reporting engine is a small set of open source Java classes that enables programmers to retrieve information from a data source, format and process it according to specified parameters, then generate user-readable output. This document
        provides guidance and instructions for using the Pentaho Reporting SDK to embed the Pentaho Reporting engine into a new or existing Java application.</p>
      <p class="p">There are four sample applications in this document, all of which are included in the SDK as <strong class="ph b">.java</strong>  files. Each adds one level of complexity or shows a different kind of output.</p>
      <p class="p">You should read this section in order, from this point all the way to the end of the second example. The remaining portion contains extra information about the Pentaho Reporting engine's capabilities, licensing details, further examples, and information
        on where to get help and support.</p>
