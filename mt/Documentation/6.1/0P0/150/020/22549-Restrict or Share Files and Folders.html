        <p class="p">Access to files or folders can be refined using the Pentaho User Console. Each file or folder can either use the default permissions or you can tailor them for specific users and roles. </p>
        <p class="p">Prior to performing this task, you need to have determined whether you are going to use the default Pentaho roles, or created specific users and roles. You must also have successfully set up your security back end. Once you establish roles, you
          can share or restrict files and folders by role-type from the administration view within the User Console.</p>
