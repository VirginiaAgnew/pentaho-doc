          <p class="p">The Pentaho solution repository uses long text strings that require a longer maximum character limit than the default UTF-8 configuration allows. Therefore, if your MySQL character set is configured to use UTF-8, you must change it to
            <strong
            class="ph b">ASCII</strong>  instead in order to use it as a Pentaho solution database. Using UTF-8 will prevent the MySQL initialization scripts from running during installation.</p>

            <p class="p">If the&nbsp;Pentaho Repository becomes corrupt, it will be unresponsive, content may be missing or inaccessible, and an error message similar to this will appear in the&nbsp;<span class="ph filepath">/data-integration-server/tomcat/logs/catalina.out</span> &nbsp;log

            <p class="p">If this happens, shut down the DI Server and restore your solution repository from a recent backup.</p>
            <p class="p">If you do not have a viable backup, you may be able to minimize data loss by identifying the exact file that is corrupt. To do this, enable debug logging by adding the following XML snippet above the&nbsp;<strong class="ph b"><root></strong> &nbsp;element
              in the&nbsp;<span class="ph filepath">/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.xml</span> &nbsp;inside your deployed pentaho.war:</p> <pre class="pre codeblock">

            <p class="p">Restart the DI Server and retry the action that caused the original error. If it occurs again, shut down the DI Server and open the<strong class="ph b">catalina.out</strong> &nbsp;log file in Tomcat. Look for the last line that appears before
              the error; it usually contains the name of the file that has been damaged. When you are finished investigating the data corruption, remove the extra logging capabilities so that your DI Server log files don't become large and unmanageable.</p>

                <p class="p">The DI Server includes a third-party H2 database recovery tool that enables you to extract raw data from your&nbsp;Pentaho Repository. This is primarily useful in situations where the repository has become corrupt, and you don't have any
                  relevant backups to restore from.</p>
                <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> &nbsp;If the database has become corrupt, the corrupted rows will not be exported. Any information contained in corrupted rows is unrecoverable through this method.</div>
                <p class="p">The recovery tool is a JAR that must be run via the Java command. The output is a SQL dump that you can then attempt to import after you've re-initialized your DI Server database.</p>
                <p class="p">You can read more about the recovery tool on the H2 Web site:&nbsp;

              <p>The&nbsp;<strong class="ph b">pg_hba.conf</strong> &nbsp;file contains host-based authentication information. If you can't run the SQL scripts that generate the Jackrabbit and Quartz databases, it's probably because the default user accounts
                for each database don't have the right permissions. To change this, edit the file to ensure that connections from local users created by the&nbsp;Pentaho&nbsp;sql&nbsp;scripts (such as&nbsp;<strong class="ph b">pentaho_user</strong> ) will
                be able to connect. The default on&nbsp;Debian-based&nbsp;systems is for local connections you use&nbsp;<strong class="ph b">ident</strong> &nbsp;authentication, which means that database users must have local user accounts. In other words,
                to continue using&nbsp;<strong class="ph b">ident</strong>, you would have to create a local&nbsp;<strong class="ph b">pentaho_user</strong> &nbsp;account. It's easier to just change the authentication method to something less restrictive,
                if your IT manager allows that approach.</p>
