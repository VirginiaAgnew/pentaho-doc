          <p class="p">By default, Tomcat has a relatively low memory allotment. This can cause out-of-memory errors in the BA Server from time to time. The below instructions will explain how to increase the memory so you don't get this error. Instructions are also
            included for renaming the tomcat6 executable file so that BA Server starts automatically.</p>
          <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">These instructions are for those who installed Pentaho Business Analytics graphically (as opposed to manually) and are Windows users.</strong> </p>

        <ol class="ol steps">
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Go to the <strong class="ph b">Windows Search Box</strong>  and enter <span class="ph filepath">C:\Program Files\pentaho\server\biserver-ee\tomcat\bin\shutdown.bat</span>  to shutdown the Pentaho BA Server.</span> 
          </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Type <span class="ph filepath">services.msc</span>  into the <strong class="ph b">Windows Search Box</strong> .</span> 
          </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Find the Pentaho Server name (<strong class="ph b">Pentaho BA Server</strong>  or <strong class="ph b">Pentaho BI Server</strong> ) and open it so you can find the <strong class="ph b">service name</strong> . The <strong class="ph b">service name</strong>  should appear at the top of the first tab (<strong class="ph b">General</strong> ). It will be <strong class="ph b">pentahobaserver</strong> .</span>             </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Go into the bin file (<span class="ph filepath">C:\Program Files\pentaho\server\biserver-ee\tomcat\bin\</span> ) and rename the <strong class="ph b">tomcat6w.exe</strong>  file to match the <strong class="ph b">service name</strong>             (<strong class="ph b">pentahobaserver</strong>  or <strong class="ph b">pentahobiserver</strong> ). This will ensure that the server starts with the software.</span> 
          </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">After you have renamed the file, open it by double-clicking on it. This will not open the file, it will allow you to edit it. You may need to right-click and select <span class="ph uicontrol">Run as Administrator</span> .
            This depends on your user permission settings.</span>  The <strong class="ph b">Properties Window</strong>  will open. </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Select the <strong class="ph b">Java</strong>  tab.</span>  </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Set the memory setting to a minimum of <strong class="ph b">4096 M</strong>  and a maximum of <strong class="ph b">6144 M</strong>, depending on your computer's memory capabilities.</span>  </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Start the Tomcat server or service.</span>  </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="section result">Your Tomcat server now has increased minimum and maximum memory limits. You can adjust the <strong class="ph b">JvmMx</strong>  number, which is a parameter that specifies the maximum limit, to a higher number if you prefer. However, if the Java
          virtual machine refuses to start with increased limits, then you will have to add more RAM to your system, stop some memory-intensive services, or reduce the maximum memory limit to a lower number. This problem occurs when there is not enough
          contiguous memory available to assign to the JVM.</div>
