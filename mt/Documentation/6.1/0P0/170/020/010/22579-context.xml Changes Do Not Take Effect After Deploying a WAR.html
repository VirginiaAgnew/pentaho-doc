        <p class="p">With a manual installation, if you deploy a WAR with a custom <strong class="ph b">context.xml</strong>, the context.xml file may not be overwritten. </p>
        <p class="p">The location and naming convention for this file are: <strong class="ph b">$CATALINA_HOME/conf/Catalina/<host>/<war name>.xml</strong> . Typically this will be something like: <strong class="ph b">/tomcat/conf/Catalina/localhost/pentaho.xml</strong> .
          If this file exists, you will have to delete it prior to deploying the <span class="ph filepath">pentaho.war</span>  if you have made any changes to <span class="ph filepath">context.xml</span> . </p>
