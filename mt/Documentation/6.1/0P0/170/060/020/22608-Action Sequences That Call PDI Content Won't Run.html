        <p class="p">If you've established a solution repository in PDI to store your jobs and transformations, and you attempt to use that stored PDI content in an action sequence on the BA Server, the action sequence will not execute. This is because the BA Server
          needs specific connection information for the Data Integration (DI) Server in order to retrieve the job or transformation.</p>
