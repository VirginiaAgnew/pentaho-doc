        <p class="p">This is the traditional variable type in PDI. You define an environment variable through the <strong class="ph b">Set Environment Variables</strong>  dialogue in the <strong class="ph b">Edit</strong>  menu, or by hand by passing it as an option
          to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) with the -D flag.</p>
        <p class="p">Environment variables are an easy way to specify the location of temporary files in a platform-independent way; for example, the <code class="ph codeph">${java.io.tmpdir}</code> variable points to the <code class="ph codeph">/tmp/</code> directory
          on Unix/Linux/OS X and to the <code class="ph codeph">C:\Documents and Settings\<username\Local Settings\Temp\</code> directory on Windows.</p>
        <p class="p">The only problem with using environment variables is that they cannot be used dynamically. For example, if you run two or more transformations or jobs at the same time on the same application server, you may get conflicts. Changes to the environment
          variables are visible to all software running on the virtual machine.</p>
