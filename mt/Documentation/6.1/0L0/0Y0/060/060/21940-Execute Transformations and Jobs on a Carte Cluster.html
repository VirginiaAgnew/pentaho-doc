          <p>Executing transformations and jobs on static and dynamic Carte clusters.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>There are two types of Carte clusters. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="ph b">Static Carte cluster</span> &nbsp;has&nbsp;a fixed schema that specifies one master node and two or more slave nodes.&nbsp;In a static cluster, you specify the&nbsp;nodes in a
        cluster at design-time,&nbsp;<em>before&nbsp;</em> you run the transformation or job.</p>
      <p>A D<span class="ph b">ynamic Carte cluster&nbsp;</span> has a schema that specifies one master node and a varying number of slave nodes. &nbsp;Unlike a static cluster, slave nodes are not known until runtime. &nbsp;Instead, you register the slave
        nodes, then at runtime,&nbsp;PDI monitors the&nbsp;slave nodes every 30 seconds to see if it is available&nbsp;to perform transformation and job processing tasks.</p>
      <p>Static clusters are a good choice for smaller environments where you don't have a lot of machines (virtual or real) to use for PDI transformations.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Dynamic clusters work well if nodes are added or removed often, such as in a cloud computing environment. Dynamic clustering is also&nbsp;more appropriate in environments where transformation performance is extremely important, or if there can potentially be multiple concurrent transformation executions.</span> </p>
