        <div class="section prereq p">You must have a report file open in order to proceed, and your data source must be accessible before you can connect to it in Report Designer. You may need to obtain database connection information from your system administrator, such as the URL,
          port number, JDBC connection string, database type, and user credentials.</div>
        <div class="section context">Follow this procedure to add a Pentaho Analysis (Mondrian) data source in Report Designer.
          <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  OLAP (Advanced) data sources differ from standard OLAP data sources only in the method by which you design and enter the MDX query. Standard OLAP data sources allow for Report Designer's built-in Metadata
            Query Editor, whereas advanced OLAP data sources require you to build a formula to calculate the query, which gives you more power over report parameterization functionality. You can also create a dynamic query through scripts; see

          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Click the yellow cylinder icon in the upper left part of the Data pane, or right-click <strong class="ph b">Data Sets</strong> .</span>  A drop-down menu with a list of supported data source types will appear. </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Select <strong class="ph b">OLAP</strong>  from the drop-down menu, then select one of the following: <strong class="ph b">Pentaho Analysis</strong>, <strong class="ph b">Pentaho Analysis (Denormalized)</strong>, or <strong class="ph b">Pentaho Analysis (Legacy)</strong> .</span>             The <strong class="ph b">Mondrian Datasource Editor</strong>  window will appear. </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">If you want to provide parameters that contain different Mondrian connection authentication credentials, click the <strong class="ph b">Edit Security</strong>  button in the upper left corner of the window, then type in the fields or variables that contain the user credentials you want to store as a parameter with this connection.</span>             The role, username, and password will be available as a security parameter when you are creating your report. </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Click <strong class="ph b">Browse</strong>, navigate to your Mondrian schema XML file, then click <strong class="ph b">Open</strong> .</span>  </li>

              have Pentaho's HSQLDB samples installed, it may be advantageous to leave the sample data sources intact in the event that you want to view the sample reports and charts at a later time. </li>

          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Click the <strong class="ph b">Test</strong>  button to ensure that the connection settings are correct.
