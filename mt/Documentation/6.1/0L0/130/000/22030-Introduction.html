          <p class="p">Pentaho Report Designer is a sophisticated report creation tool that you can use standalone, or as part of the larger Pentaho Business Analytics distribution. It enables professionals to create highly detailed, print-quality reports based on
            adequately prepared data from virtually any data source.</p>
          <p class="p">Report Designer is one of several ways to create reports with Pentaho software. Through the BA Server's Web-based Pentaho User Console, you can also use the Interactive Reporting interface, or you can integrate the Pentaho Reporting engine (on
            which Report Designer is built) into your own software.</p>
          <p class="p">This section covers all of the major Report Designer features and functions, from adding a data source to working with conditional formatting and formulas. You can read it cover-to-cover to attain a reasonably comprehensive Report Designer education,
            or you can use it strictly as a reference to consult when you run into an operational challenge.</p>
