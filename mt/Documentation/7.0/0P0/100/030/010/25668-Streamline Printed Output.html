        <p class="p">Pentaho Reporting's overall performance is chiefly affected by the amount of printed content that it has to generate. The more content you generate, the more time the Reporting engine will take to perform all layout computations.</p>
        <p class="p">Large inline subreports are notorious for poor performance. This is because the layouted output of an inline subreport is always stored in memory. The master report's layouting pauses until the subreport is fully generated, then it's inserted
          into the master report's layout model and subsequently printed. Memory consumption for this layouting model is high because the full layout model is kept in memory until the report is finished. If there is a large amount of content in the subreport,
          you will run into &quot;out of memory&quot; exceptions.</p>
        <p class="p">An inline subreport that consumes the full width of the root-level band should be converted into a banded subreport. Banded subreports are layouted and all output is generated while the subreport is processed. The memory footprint for that is
          small because only the active band or the active page has to be held in memory.</p>
        <p class="p">When images are embedded from remote servers (HTTP/FTP sources), you must ensure that the server produces a <strong class="ph b">LastModifiedDate</strong>  header. The Reporting engine uses that header as part of its caching system, and if it is
          missing, the remote images will not be cached, forcing the engine to retrieve them every time they're needed.</p>
        <p class="p">Caching must be configured properly via a valid ehcache configuration file, which is stored in the Pentaho Web app in the <span class="ph filepath">/WEB-INF/classes/</span>  directory. If caching is disabled or misconfigured, then there will be
          performance problems when loading reports and resources.</p>
        <p class="p">Within Pentaho Reporting there are three output types, each with its own memory and CPU consumption characteristics. Each is listed below with an explanation of how it is optimized.</p>

        <h2 class="editable">Paginated Exports</h2>
        <p class="p">A pageable report generates a stream of pages. Each page has the same height, even if the page is not fully filled with content. When a page is filled, the layouted page will be passed over to the output target to render it in either a Graphics2D
          or a streaming output (PDF, Plaintext, HTML, etc.) context.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <div id="section_2" class="mt-page-section"><span id="Page_break_methods"></span> 
        <h2 class="editable">Page break methods</h2>
        <p class="p">When the content contains a manual pagebreak, the page will be considered full. If the pagebreak is a <strong class="ph b">before-print</strong>  break, then the break will be converted to an <strong class="ph b">after-break</strong>, the internal
          report states will be rolled back, and the report processing restarts to regenerate the layout with the new constraints. A similar rollback happens if the current band does not fit on the page. Because of this, you would generally prefer break-before
          over break-after.</p>
        <p class="p">So for large reports, you might consider removing manual page breaks and limiting the width of bands.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <div id="section_3" class="mt-page-section"><span id="Page_states"></span> 
        <h2 class="editable">Page states</h2>
        <p class="p">When processing a pageable report, the reporting engine assumes that the report will be run in <strong class="ph b">interactive mode</strong>, which allows for parameterization control. To make browsing through the pages faster, a number of page
          states will be stored to allow report end-users to restart output processing at the point in the report where they adjust the parameters.</p>
        <p class="p">Reports that are run to fully export all pages usually do not need to store those page states. A series of Report engine settings controls the number and frequency of the page states stored:</p>
        <ul class="ul">
          <li class="li">org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.performance.pagestates.PrimaryPoolSize=20</li>
          <li class="li">org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.performance.pagestates.SecondaryPoolFrequency=4</li>
          <li class="li">org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.performance.pagestates.SecondaryPoolSize=100</li>
          <li class="li">org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.performance.pagestates.TertiaryPoolFrequency=10</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p">The Reporting engine uses three lists to store page states. The default configuration looks as follows:</p>
        <ol class="ol">
          <li class="li">The first 20 states (Pages 1 to 20) are stored in the <strong class="ph b">primary pool</strong> . All states are stored with strong references and will not be garbage collected.</li>
          <li class="li">The next 400 states (pages 21 to 421) are stored into the <strong class="ph b">secondary pool</strong> . Of those, every fourth state is stored with a strong reference and cannot be garbage collected as long as the report processor is open.</li>
          <li class="li">All subsequent states (pages > 421) are stored in the <strong class="ph b">tertiary pool</strong>  and every tenth state is stored as strong reference.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="p">So for a 2000-page report, a total of about 270 states will be stored with strong references.</p>
        <p class="p">In server mode, the settings could be cut down to:</p> <pre class="pre codeblock">
org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.performance.pagestates.PrimaryPoolSize=1
org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.performance.pagestates.
  SecondaryPoolFrequency=1
org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.performance.pagestates.SecondaryPoolSize=1
org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.performance.pagestates.
  TertiaryPoolFrequency=100</pre>
        <p class="p">This reduces the number of states stored for a 2000 page report to 22, thus cutting the memory consumption for the page states to a 1/10th.</p>
        <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  In the current versioin full exports do not generate page states and thus these settings have no effect on such exports. They still affect the interactive mode.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id="section_4" class="mt-page-section"><span id="Table_Exports"></span> 
      <h2 class="editable">Table Exports</h2>
      <p class="p">A table export produces tabular output from a fully-layouted display model. A table export cannot handle overlapping elements and therefore has to remove them.</p>
      <p class="p">To support layout debugging, the Reporting engine stores a lot of extra information in the layout model. This increases memory consumption but makes it easier to develop Reporting solutions. These Reporting engine debug settings should never be
        enabled in production environments:</p>
      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.modules.output.table.base.ReportCellConflicts</li>
        <li class="li">org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.modules.output.table.base.VerboseCellMarkers</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  These settings are <strong class="ph b">false</strong>  by default. Report Designer comes with its own method to detect overlapping elements and does not rely on these settings.</div>
    </div>
    <div id="section_5" class="mt-page-section"><span id="HTML_Exports"></span> 
      <h2 class="editable">HTML Exports</h2>
      <p class="p">In HTML exports, there are a few Reporting engine settings that can affect export performance. The first is <strong class="ph b">CopyExternalImages</strong> :</p> <pre class="pre codeblock">
org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.modules.output.table.html.CopyExternalImages=
  true</pre>
      <p class="p">This controls whether images from HTTP/HTTPS or FTP sources are linked from their original source or copied (and possibly re-encoded) into the output directory. The default is <strong class="ph b">true</strong> ; this ensures that reports always
        have the same image. Set to <strong class="ph b">false</strong>  if the image is dynamically generated, in which case you'd want to display the most recent view.</p>
      <p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Style</strong>  and <strong class="ph b">ForceBufferedWriting</strong>  settings control how stylesheets are produced and whether the generated HTML output will be held in a buffer until the report processing is finished:</p>
      <pre class="pre codeblock">
org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.modules.output.table.html.
  ForceBufferedWriting=true</pre>
      <p class="p">Style information can be stored inline, or in the
        <head> element of the generated HTML file:</p> <pre class="pre codeblock">
org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.modules.output.table.html.InlineStyles=true</pre>
      <p class="p">Or in an external CSS file:</p> <pre class="pre codeblock">
org.pentaho.reporting.engine.classic.core.modules.output.table.html.ExternalStyle=true</pre>
      <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">ForceBufferedWriting</strong>  should be set to true if a report uses an external CSS file. Browsers request all resources they find in the HTML stream, so if a browser requests a style sheet that has not yet been fully generated,
        the report cannot display correctly. It is safe to disable buffering if the styles are inline because the browser will not need to fetch an external style sheet in that case. Buffered content will appear slower to the user than non-buffered content
        because browsers render partial HTML pages while data is still being received from the server. Buffering will delay that rendering until the report is fully processed on the server.</p>
