          <p class="p">Pentaho Aggregation Designer's startup script uses the default memory settings for your Java environment, which may be insufficient for your work. If you're experiencing an OutOfMemory exception, you must increase the amount of heap space available
            to Aggregation Designer by changing the Java options that set memory allocation. Follow the directions below to accomplish this.</p>
          <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  In the examples below, the memory size notations are <strong class="ph b">m</strong>  for megabytes and <strong class="ph b">g</strong>  for gigabytes. You can use whichever is most appropriate for your situation.</div>

          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Edit the <strong class="ph b">startaggregationdesigner</strong>  script and modify your Java command to include an <strong class="ph b">-Xmx</strong>  line that specifies a large upper memory limit.</span>

        <div class="section result">The Java virtual machine instance that Aggregation Designer uses now has access to more heap space, which should solve OutOfMemory exceptions and increase performance.</div>
