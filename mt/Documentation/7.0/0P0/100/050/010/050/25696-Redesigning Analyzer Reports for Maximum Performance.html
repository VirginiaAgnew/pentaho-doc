        <p class="p">Once you have an idea of what you want to show with your Analyzer report, you will almost certainly have to redesign it to be more performant. Because an Analyzer report is basically a hierarchical list of actions, the order in which fields and
          filters are added to the report can make a big difference in query response time. Even though this does not change the report's graphical output, what happens behind the scenes can make that output display more quickly.</p>
        <p class="p">When you re-create your reports, follow this process for best performance:</p>
        <ol class="pentaho-list-ordered">
          <li class="li">Add and filter by low-cardinality dimensions first</li>
          <li class="li">Add measures to the report</li>
          <li class="li">Add high-cardinality dimensions last</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  When filtering, always choose include/exclude over contains/doesn't contain.</div>
