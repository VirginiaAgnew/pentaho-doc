        <p class="p">Every time you generate content on the Pentaho Server, temporary files are created on the local file system in the <span class="ph filepath">/pentaho-solutions/system/tmp/</span>  folder. In some cases, the Pentaho&nbsp;Server may not properly
          purge that temporary content, leaving behind orphaned artifacts that can slowly build up and reduce performance on the volume that contains the <code>pentaho-solutions</code> folder. One way to address this issue&nbsp;is to mount the <code>/tmp</code>          folder on a separate volume, thereby siphoning off all disk trash asssociated with creating new content. However, you will still have to perform a manual garbage collection procedure on this folder&nbsp;on a regular basis. You can accomplish
          this via a script that runs through your system scheduler; it should be safe to delete any content files in this directory that are more than a week old.</p>
