          <p class="p">You can use the Apache httpd Web server to handle delivery of static content and facilitation of socket connections, neither of which is done efficiently through Tomcat alone, especially under heavy traffic or when accepting connections from
            the Internet.</p>
        </div>
        <ol class="ol steps">
          <li class="li step"><span class="ph cmd">Install Apache 2.2.x -- with SSL support -- through your operating system's preferred installation method. For most people, this will be through a package manager. It's also perfectly valid to download and install the reference implementation from <a class="xref external" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.apache.org">http://www.apache.org</a> .</span>             It is possible to use Apache 1.3, but you will have to modify the instructions on your own from this point onward.</li>
          <li class="li step"><span class="ph cmd">If it has started as a consequence of installing, stop the Apache server or service.</span> </li>
          <li class="li step"><span class="ph cmd">Retrieve or create your SSL keys.</span>  If you do not know how to generate self-signed certificates, refer to the OpenSSL documentation. Most production environments have SSL certificates issued by a certificate authority
            such as Thawte or Verisign.</li>
          <li class="li step"><span class="ph cmd">Check to see if you already have the Tomcat Connector installed on your system. You can generally accomplish this by searching your filesystem for <strong class="ph b">mod_jk</strong>, though you can also search your <strong class="ph b">http.conf</strong>  file for <strong class="ph b">mod_jk</strong> . If it is present, then you only need to be concerned with the Apache httpd configuration details and can skip this step. If it is not there, then the Tomcat Connector module needs to be installed. If you are using Linux or BSD, use your package manager or the Ports system to install <strong class="ph b">mod_jk</strong> . For all other platforms, visit the <a class="xref external" target="_blank" title="Tomcat Connector download page" rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-connectors/jk/binaries/">http://www.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-connectors/jk/binaries/</a>, then click on the directory for your operating system. The module will be either an <strong class="ph b">.so</strong>  (for Linux, BSD, OS X, and Solaris) or <strong class="ph b">.dll</strong>  (for Windows) file. Save it to your Apache modules directory, which is generally <span class="ph filepath">C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache2\modules\</span>             on Windows, and <span class="ph filepath">/usr/lib/apache2/modules/</span>  on Unix-like operating systems, though this can vary depending on your Apache configuration.</span> 
          </li>
          <li class="li step"><span class="ph cmd">Edit your <strong class="ph b">httpd.conf</strong>  file with a text editor and add the following text to the end of the file, modifying the paths and filenames as instructed in the comments:</span> 
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="pentaho-note">Some operating systems use modular httpd configuration files and have unique methods of including each separate piece into one central file. Ensure that you are not accidentally interfering with an auto-generated mod_jk configuration before
              you continue. In many cases, some of the configuration example below will have to be cut out (such as the <strong class="ph b">LoadModule</strong>  statement). In some cases (such as with Ubuntu Linux), httpd.conf may be completely empty,
              in which case you should still be able to add the below lines to it. Replace <strong class="ph b">example.com</strong>  with your hostname or domain name.</p> <pre class="pre codeblock">
