    <p>Pentaho shares files and folders&nbsp;across teams and products through the Pentaho Repository. The Pentaho Repository is an environment for&nbsp;collaborative analysis and ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) development. From the&nbsp;Pentaho User
      Console (PUC), you can&nbsp;

    <p>As the Pentaho Repository grows, it may become too large for effective system performance. If a hardware upgrade is expensive, consider purging some of the data within the repository using

This loss can be minimized by routine backups. You can backup or restore the Pentaho Repository through <a title="Backup and Restore Pentaho Repositories" rel="internal" href="http://help.pentaho.com/Documentation/7.0/0P0/Managing_the_Pentaho_Repository/Backup_and_Restore_Pentaho_Repositories">a command line interface</a> .</span> </span>
