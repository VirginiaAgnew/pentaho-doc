    <p>This guide covers post-installation and maintenance tasks for the Pentaho Server and related tools. These tasks include setting up data connections, importing and exporting content, creating clusters, and configuring logging and monitoring operations.
      You can perform these tasks in any order.</p>
    <p>For this guide, we assume you have installed and configured the Pentaho Suite. We also assume you are an IT administrator who knows where data is stored, how to connect to it, details about the computing environment, and how to use the command line
      to issue commands for Microsoft Windows or Linux.</p>
    <p>Administration tasks for Pentaho Business Analysis (BA) components are handled through the Pentaho User Console. Some administration tasks for Pentaho Data Integration (DI) components are handled through the design tool, Spoon. Other tasks are handled
      through the command line interface. All BA component administration tasks require you
      <a href="/Documentation/7.0/0H0/060/010/010" rel="internal">log on to the Pentaho User Console</a>  with the administrator user name and password.</p>
