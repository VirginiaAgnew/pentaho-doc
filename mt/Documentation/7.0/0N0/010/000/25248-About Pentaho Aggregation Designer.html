      <p class="p">This section provides you with instructions and recommendations for designing aggregate tables for Mondrian ROLAP models. The use of aggregate tables can dramatically improve the query performance of analysis solutions.</p>

        <p class="p"><strong>Audience: </strong> This document is written for Database Administrators and consultants who design specific aggregate tables or get recommendations for aggregate tables based on an intelligent adviser algorithm. It is assumed that you,
          the reader, have a strong understanding of database design and concepts (such as database modeling, SQL security, and performance), and are familiar with aggregate table concepts.</p>

          <p class="p">The Pentaho Aggregation Designer simplifies the creation and deployment of aggregate tables that improve the performance of your Pentaho Analysis (Mondrian) OLAP cubes. Pentaho Analysis is a pure, relational OLAP engine that works solely with
            the data stored in your relational database rather than providing its own multidimensional data storage model. This simplifies deployment and data management, but places limitations on performance when working with very large data sets (fact
            tables with more than 10 million records and/or cubes with a high cardinality of levels and members). To improve performance in these scenarios, Pentaho Analysis supports aggregate tables. Aggregate tables coexist with the base fact table
            and contain pre-aggregated measures built from the fact table. This improves performance by enabling the Mondrian engine to fulfill certain summary level queries from the smaller aggregate table versus aggregating a large number of individual
            facts from the base fact table.</p>
          <p class="p">The Pentaho Aggregation Designer provides you with a simple interface that allows you to create aggregate tables from levels within the dimensions you specify. Based on these selections, the Aggregation Designer generates the Data Definition
            Language (DDL) for creating the aggregate tables, the Data Manipulation Language (DML) for populating them, and an updated Mondrian schema which references the new aggregate tables. If you are unfamiliar with aggregate table design concepts,
            the Aggregation Designer also includes an intelligent adviser that evaluates the structure and cardinality of your OLAP cube and recommends some initial aggregate tables to create for improving performance.</p>
