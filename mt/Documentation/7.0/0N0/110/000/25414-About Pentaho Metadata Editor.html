      <p class="p">This section provides you with information and instructions to help you use the <strong class="ph b">Pentaho Metadata Editor</strong>, a tool that allows you to build metadata models and domains. There is also an exercise included that walks you
        through creating a metadata model using a small sample database.</p>
      <p class="p">There is sample data available if you want to test Metadata Editor before importing your own data. This sample data is inside of the Pentaho download. This process will be covered later in this section.</p>
      <p class="p"><strong>Audience:</strong>  To use the&nbsp;Pentaho Metadata Editor, you must have database administrator (DBA) skills, such as knowing how to import tables, create relationships between tables, assign aggregations, add categories, and assign security
        as well as an extensive knowledge of your databases. You must also know what type of data interests your business users, in order to&nbsp;determine whether a column should be a measure or a dimension, for example. These skills will allow you to
        map a business user model (logical model) to a complex relational database,&nbsp;which can then&nbsp;lets your users create Pentaho reports without a DBA's assistance.</p>
