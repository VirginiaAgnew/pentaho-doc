        <p class="p">Parent concepts are independent hierarchies of concepts that can be assigned to one or more business objects through the navigation tree. Before you can assign a parent concept you must first learn how to create one.</p>
        <p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Concept</strong>  editor allows you to build concepts to be used as parent concepts. The ability to isolate the concepts, name them, then associate the named concept with one or more business objects gives you flexibility
          and good concept management. Another feature of the Concept editor is that you can define concepts that build upon other concepts. By nesting concepts this way, you minimize the number of properties you must repeatedly define and create a good
          inheritance hierarchy.</p>

            <p class="p">The default Concept is the default set of properties assigned to objects, mainly used for formatting. For example, the mask for all currencies could be set to $#,##0.00;($#,##0.00) by default. Every model contains a default concept called
              <strong class="ph b">Base</strong> . This concept is applied as the parent concept to all physical columns created under a connection. The default concept includes metadata properties that are commonly defined and sets a base line set of
              metadata for all physical columns in the metadata model. The purpose of the default concept is to provide legitimate values for common metadata properties that may not be set in other places in your hierarchy. You can update, add, and delete
              metadata properties on the default concept. You can also remove the default concept as the parent concept for any and all physical columns. You cannot, however, delete the default concept from the list of concepts in the Concept editor.
