        <p class="p">Analyzer can format number fields in a few different ways:</p>
        <ul class="ul">
          <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Default</strong> : Uses the cell formatter specified in the Mondrian schema</li>
          <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">General Number</strong> : A number that can be separated by commas and decimal places, but has no sign. Pound symbols represent number places if they exist, and zeroes represent potential holders for places that do not exist.
            So for a definition of <strong class="ph b">00#,###.00</strong>, the number 11223.4 would be represented in Analyzer as 011,223.40.</li>
          <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Percentage</strong> : A number that can be separated by commas and decimal places, followed by a percent sign. Pound symbols represent number places if they exist, and zeroes represent potential holders for places that do
            not exist. So for a definition of <strong class="ph b">00#,###.00%</strong>, the number 11223.4 would be represented in Analyzer as 011,223.40%.</li>
          <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Currency</strong> : A number that can be separated by commas and decimal places, preceded by a currency sign. Pound symbols represent number places if they exist, and zeroes represent potential holders for places that do
            not exist. So for a definition of <strong class="ph b">$00#,###.00</strong>, the number 11223.4 would be represented in Analyzer as $011,223.40.</li>
          <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Expression</strong> : A custom format defined by some user-supplied logic. See

        </ul>
        <p class="p">To change the formatting of a measure, right-click on it in the grid, then select <strong class="ph b">Column Name and Format...</strong>  from the context menu.</p>
        <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  Formatting options apply to both the report viewer and exports (PDF, XLS).</div>
