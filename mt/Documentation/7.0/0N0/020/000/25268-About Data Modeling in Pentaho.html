          <p>This section helps BA administrators prepare their data for use with the Pentaho Analyzer and Pentaho Report Designer. The collection of analysis components in Pentaho Business Analytics helps you visualize data trends and reveal useful information
            about your business. You can gain these insights by creating static reports from an analysis data source, traversing an analysis cube through an Analyzer report, showing how data points compare by using charts, and monitoring the status of
            specific trends and thresholds with dashboards.</p>

      <p class="p">Before you can begin using any client tools, you must prepare your data:</p>
      <ol>
        <li class="p">Consolidate data from disparate sources into one canonical source and optimize it for the metrics you want to analyze.</li>
        <li class="p">Create an analysis schema to describe the data.</li>
        <li class="p">Iteratively improve that schema so that it meets your users' needs.</li>
        <li class="p">Create aggregation tables for frequently computed views.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="p">When you have your data prepped, you can begin to use Pentaho&nbsp;Business Analytics.</p>

        <h2 class="editable">Pentaho Business Analytics&nbsp;and OLAP</h2>
        <p class="p">Pentaho Business Analytics&nbsp;is built on the Mondrian online analytical processing (<strong class="ph b">OLAP</strong> ) engine. OLAP relies on a multidimensional data model that, when queried, returns a dataset that resembles a grid. The rows
          and columns that describe and bring meaning to the data in that grid are <strong class="ph b">dimensions</strong>, and the hard numerical values in each cell are the <strong class="ph b">measures</strong>  or <strong class="ph b">facts</strong> .
          In Pentaho Analyzer, dimensions are shown in yellow and measures are in blue.</p>
        <p class="p">OLAP requires a properly prepared data source in the form of a star or snowflake schema that defines a logical multi-dimensional database and maps it to a physical database model. Once you have your initial data structure in place, you must design
          a descriptive layer for it in the form of a Mondrian schema, which consists of one or more cubes, hierarchies, and members. Only when you have a tested and optimized Mondrian schema is your data prepared on a basic level for end-user tools like
          Pentaho Analyzer. See
          <a class="xref" title="Data Modeling Workflow" rel="internal" href="http://help.pentaho.com/Documentation/7.0/0N0/020/030">Workflow Overview</a>  for a more comprehensive overview of the Pentaho Analysis data preparation workflow, including which Pentaho tools you will need to execute this process.</p>
        <p class="p">For concise definitions of OLAP terms, refer to
