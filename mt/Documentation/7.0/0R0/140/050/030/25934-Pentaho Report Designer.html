        <p class="p">The examples in this section accept data source input and create user-readable output, which is essentially what the Pentaho Report Designer does with its graphical user interface. In addition to being a powerful report creation and design tool,
          Report Designer is also an extraordinary example of a Java application that embeds the Pentaho Reporting engine.</p>

        <p class="p">You can also create report definition files with Report Designer, then use your custom Reporting engine-based application to render them at a later time.</p>
