Basically, Dashboard Designer
                enables you to display content in a predefined layout; there is a low degree of customization, but greater ease of use than other dashboard methodologies.</td>

              <td class="entry" valign="top" headers="d827e27 d827e30 ">CDF is an open, community-supported framework for creating dashboards from XML configuration files and HTML templates. CDF dashboards must be created by hand from a text editor and are thus not nearly as quick and easy to create as Dashboard
                Designer dashboards, but there is much more flexibility with how content is displayed and refreshed.</td>

              <td class="entry" valign="top" headers="d827e27 d827e30 ">If you are a Java Web developer (or have one on staff), you can create your own JSPs that display Pentaho content in whatever ways are possible through the BI Platform's content and service APIs. Of course this is the most difficult way
                to create a dashboard, but it allows you complete freedom in terms of the type of content that can be displayed, and how that content is laid out. Depending on the complexity of the design and the technical details of the implementation,
                a JSP dashboard could perform better than CDF or Dashboard Designer, but will take considerably longer to develop.</td>
