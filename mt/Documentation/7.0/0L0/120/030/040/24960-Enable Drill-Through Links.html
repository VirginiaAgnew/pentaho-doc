<content type="text/html" title="Enable Drill-Through Links">
  <body>
    <p class="p">You use drill-through links in Analyzer to view all individual records that make up an aggregate value in your analysis report. This will turn all non-calculated number fields into links which, when clicked, bring up a configurable data grid that
      enables you to quickly view more details for that data point, without having to reconfigure your report. The drill-through grid shows all levels and non-calculated measures that are defined in the report cube by default.</p>
    <p class="p">If needed, you can select the columns you want to show in the grid so that report designers only see the selected columns. This is useful if your report cube contains many levels and measures and you want to show only specific data for analysis.</p>
    <p>Drill-through links are not available under the following conditions:</p>
    <ul class="pentaho-list-unordered">
      <li>Any calculated measures, including schema-defined calculated measures and user-defined measures, such as Percentages, Running Sum, and Trend measures.</li>
      <li>Measures and levels set as hidden in the Available Fields list will not be visible in the Drill-Through view. For more information, see
        <a title="Hide and Unhide Available Fields" rel="internal" href="http://help.pentaho.com/Documentation/7.0/0L0/120/030/Hide_and_Unhide_Available_Fields">Hide or Unhide Available Fields</a> .</li>
      <li>Subtotaled cells.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="pentaho-note">Drill-through links are not available for any calculated measures, including schema-defined calculated measures and user-defined measures, such as Percentages, Running Sum, and Trend measures. Drill-through links are also not available on subtotaled
      cells.</p>
    <p class="p">The directions below guide you through the process of setting up drill-through links.</p>
    <ol class="pentaho-list-ordered">
      <li class="li step"><span class="ph cmd">Open the Analyzer report to add drill-through links.</span> </li>
      <li class="li step"><span class="ph cmd">Click the <strong class="ph b">More actions and options</strong>  icon in the report toolbar, and select <strong class="ph b">Report Options</strong>  from the drop-down menu.</span>  The <strong class="ph b">Report Options</strong>         dialog box appears.</li>
      <li class="li step"><span class="ph cmd">Select the <strong class="ph b">Show drill-through links on Measure cells</strong>  check box.</span> </li>
      <li class="li step"><span class="ph cmd">Click the <strong class="ph b">Select Columns</strong>  link to choose the columns you want to appear.</span> </li>
      <li class="li step"><span class="ph cmd">Click <strong class="ph b">OK</strong> .</span>  The measure fields in your report will turn into links.</li>
      <li class="li step"><span class="ph cmd">Click a link in the report to see a data grid that shows all of the available details for that value.</span> </li>
      <li class="li step"><span class="ph cmd">You can also add or remove columns from this grid, by clicking <strong class="ph b">Select Columns</strong>  at the top of the data grid. You can also search and toggle the sort order in the same way as the <strong class="ph b">Available Fields</strong>  list. </span> 
        <ol class="ol substeps" id="33ad3195-1548-41a1-96bf-0c53c08fe957__analysis_analyzer_drilldown_links__substeps_uvr_zsn_rm" start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" type="a">
          <li class="li substep"><span class="ph cmd">Click to deselect the columns that you want to hide.</span> </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>You now have drill-through links for numeric, non-calculated members. If you choose, you can later disable the drill-through links by deselecting the <strong class="ph b">Show drill-through links ...</strong>  check box.</p>
