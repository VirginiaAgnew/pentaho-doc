      <p>Before you can create an Interactive Report, you must have access to a data source.</p>
      <p>The data source for an Interactive Report is based on the Pentaho relational data model, also known as the metadata data model. This model enables the Pentaho system to present data in reports in meaningful business terms instead of in abstract
        terms. For example, a table referred to as <strong>CUST_TBLE or ORDR_TBLE</strong>  in the data model can be presented in your report as <strong>Customers and Orders</strong> .</p>
