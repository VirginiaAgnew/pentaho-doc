      <p>You can group data in your Interactive reports so that related items appear together. Filters can be used to restrict or limit data in a report, so that you can build the report to show only the information that you want to view.</p>

        <h2 class="editable">Group Data in Your New Interactive Report</h2>
        <p class="p">You can organize the data in your Interactive reports by grouping it by different fields, such as geographic region, product line, or both.</p>
        <p class="p">Here are three quick ways to group data in your report:</p>
        <ol class="pentaho-list-ordered">
          <li class="li step">To group data that is already a column in your report, click the column header and drag it up above the other headers in your report. Release the mouse button once the horizontal green line appears.</li>
          <li class="li step">To group data in a field that is not already a column in your report, drag it from the <strong>Data</strong>  tab in the left pane. Drop the field in the space above the report headers.</li>
          <li class="li step">To group data by more than one field, you can nest it into a group by dragging the field or column header beneath the original group.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Now your data is grouped and organized in your Interactive report. You can also sort the data by clicking on the arrows that appear next to the group names, or

        <p>After you are done, just click <strong>Save </strong> or <strong>Save As</strong>  and choose the location to store your report.</p>

      <div id="section_3" class="mt-page-section"><span id="Add_Filters_to_Your_Interactive_Report"></span> 
        <h2 class="editable">Add Filters to Your Interactive Report</h2>
        <p class="p">Filters are used to restrict or limit data in a report, so that you can build the report to show only the information that you want to view.</p>
        <p>For example, a typical report shows sales by product line. A time filter on <strong>Quarter </strong> restricts the data so that only sales for one quarter are shown. If you then add a regional filter for Europe, the report would display data pertaining
          to European sales for that quarter. If you add a filter on another field to exclude a product, the report would display data pertaining to European sales in that quarter, which are also not a part of the excluded product line.</p>
        <p>These steps describe how to add filters to an Interactive report.</p>
        <ol class="pentaho-list-ordered">
          <li class="li step">Login to the User Console, and click <strong>Browse Files</strong>  to browse to the location of your Interactive report.</li>
          <li class="li step">Open the report. Click the plus sign next to <strong>No Filters</strong>  on the toolbar near the top of the report. A workspace for filters appears at the top of the report.</li>
          <li class="li step">From the <strong>Available Fields</strong>  panel, drag fields into the <strong>Filter Panel</strong> . The <strong>Filter</strong>  dialog box appears. Notice that the values associated with the field are listed in the dialog box. You can choose
            one of these values, or you can enable <strong>Match a specific string</strong>  to filter the report on a specific string of data.</li>
          <li class="li step">Select the value or values that you want from the <strong>Add Selected</strong>  list and click the arrow to move it into the right pane. The value appears with a green check mark next to it in the right pane.</li>
          <li class="li step">After you have selected all of the values that you need from the list, click <strong>OK</strong>  to exit the dialog box.</li>
          <li class="li step">Repeat this process for each field that you want to filter on. The Interactive report displays data for the chosen values only.</li>
          <li class="li step">Save your report.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Your report is filtered and saved. You can click Undo or Reset to return to the previous version of the report.</p>
        <div id="section_4" class="mt-page-section"><span id="Add_a_Filter_on_Date_Fields"></span> 
          <h3 class="editable">Add a Filter on Date Fields</h3>
          <p>Use these steps to add a filter that matches a specific value.</p>
          <ol class="pentaho-list-ordered">
            <li class="li step">In the toolbar, click <strong>Filters</strong> . The <strong>Filters Panel</strong>  appears above the report.</li>
            <li class="li step">Click and drag a <strong>date field</strong>  from the right pane into the <strong>Filters</strong>  area. The <strong>Filters</strong>  dialog box opens.</li>
            <li class="li step">Next to the field name, choose a date constraint from the list, then click the small arrow on the right to display the date picker. To create a &quot;date range&quot; you must add two filters: one for the start date, and one for the end date.</li>
            <li class="li step">In the date picker choose your date.</li>
            <li class="li step">Click <strong>OK</strong>  to save your filter.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The report display updates as soon as the filter is added. The filter appears in the Filter box and an icon displays next to the field name in the <strong>Data</strong>  tab. Also, the number of filters added to the report appears next to the
            filter icon in the toolbar.</p>
          <p>You can edit the filter by clicking <strong>Edit</strong> . You can delete the filter by clicking the delete button.</p>

        <div id="section_5" class="mt-page-section"><span id="Flag_a_Filter_Constraint_for_Use_as_a_Dashboard_Parameter"></span> 
          <h3 class="editable">Flag a Filter Constraint for Use as a Dashboard Parameter</h3>
          <p>You can flag a filter constraint for as a parameter. The parameter name will appear on the <strong>Parameters </strong> tab in Dashboard Designer when you place the report into a dashboard panel. You can also edit parameters while working in
            Report Designer.</p>
          <ol class="pentaho-list-ordered">
            <li class="li step">After you create your filter, enter the parameter name in the <strong>Parameter Name</strong>  text box.</li>
            <li class="li step">Click <strong>OK</strong> .</li>
            <li class="li step">Save your report.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The parameter is ready to be used in Dashboard Designer. To see if the parameter appears in Dashboard Designer, insert your report into a dashboard panel. The parameter name will appear on the <strong>Parameters</strong>  tab.</p>
