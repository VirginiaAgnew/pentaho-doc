        <p class="p">The Business Analytics installer does not create program entries in the K menu or Applications menu in Linux desktop environments, so you will have to start Report Designer by navigating to the <span class="ph filepath">/pentaho/design-tools/report-designer/</span>           directory and running the <strong class="ph b">report-designer.sh</strong>  script. You can do this from your file manager, or from a terminal window.</p>
