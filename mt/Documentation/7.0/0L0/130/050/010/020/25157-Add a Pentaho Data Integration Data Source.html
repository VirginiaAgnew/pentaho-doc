        <div class="section prereq p">Use the Pentaho Data Integration data source option if you want to create a report that contains data from any step in a PDI transformation. This is particularly useful if you want to create a report that includes data from transformation steps
          such as Splunk Input or Splunk Output. You must have a report file open in order to proceed, and your data source must be accessible before you can connect to it in Report Designer. As mentioned previously in this section, the first time you
          create a Kettle data source you must also copy all of the JAR files from <span class="ph filepath">/pentaho/design-tools/data-integration/lib/</span>  and all of its subdirectories <strong class="ph b">except the JDBC subdirectory</strong>  to
          <span class="ph filepath">/pentaho/design-tools/report-designer/lib/</span>  in order to access it through Report Designer.
          <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  Your data source must not contain multi-select parameters. Data Integration does not accept array parameters; only strings are accepted.</div>
