          <p class="p">You can use Report Designer to edit a report created with Pentaho Interactive Reporting. This procedure assumes that you have a <span class="ph filepath">.prpti</span>  report created with Pentaho Interactive Reporting</p>

            the Pentaho Server and Report Designer on the same machine, this step may not be necessary. However, you may need to create a copy of the .prpti file if you want to continue using the original in Interactive Reporting.</li>
          <li class="li step"><span class="ph cmd">Copy the <strong class="ph b">.xmi</strong>  data source file from the solution in the Pentaho Server's <span class="ph filepath">/pentaho-solutions/</span>  directory to the workstation that has Report Designer.</span>

            machines. If you have the <span class="ph cmd">Pentaho&nbsp;</span> Server on the same system with Report Designer, you can continue using that XMI file, but you still have to provide the local file system location in place of the server's
            URL.</li>
          <li class="li step"><span class="ph cmd">Establish a data source connection to the database referenced in the XMI file.</span>  The XMI file defines a metadata model, which can be used as a data source so long as the database it provides metadata for is available
            to Report Designer.</li>
          <li class="li step"><span class="ph cmd">Copy the appropriate JDBC driver for the XMI database connection to the <span class="ph filepath">/report-designer/lib/jdbc/</span>  directory.</span>  You may already have an appropriate database driver; if so, skip this
            step.</li>
