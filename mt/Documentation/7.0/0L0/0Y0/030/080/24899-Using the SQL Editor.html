        <p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">SQL Editor</strong>  is good tool to use when you must execute standard SQL commands for tasks such as creating tables, dropping indexes and modifying fields. The SQL Editor is used to preview and execute DDL (Data Definition
          Language) generated by Spoon such as &quot;create/alter table, &quot;create index,&quot; and &quot;create sequence&quot; SQL commands. For example, if you add a Table Output step to a transformation and click the SQL button at the bottom of
          the Table Input dialog box, Spoon automatically generates the necessary DDL for the output step to function properly and presents it to the end user through the SQL Editor.</p>
        <p class="p">Below are some points to consider:</p>
        <ul class="ul">
          <li class="li">Multiple SQL Statements must be separated by semi-colons.</li>
          <li class="li">Before SQL Statements are sent to the database to be executed, Spoon removes returns, line-feeds, and separating semi-colons.</li>
          <li class="li">Pentaho Data Integration clears the database cache for the database connection on which you launch DDL statements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p">The SQL Editor does not recognize the dialects of all supported databases. That means that creating stored procedures, triggers, and other database-specific objects may pose problems. Consider using the tools that came with the database in these
          instances.</p>
