              <p class="p">When you have three or more tables that require outer joins, the <em class="ph i">order</em>  in which the tables are joined is critical. Consider the example below:</p>
              <img alt="" class="internal default" src="http://help.pentaho.com/@api/deki/files/8179/48_outer_joins.png?revision=1" />
              <p class="p">In the sample preview below, the entries, <strong>1</strong>, <strong>2</strong>  ,<strong>3</strong>, and <strong>4</strong>  listed under&nbsp;in <strong>TABLE4</strong>  are taken and outer-joined with the records in the two other tables.
                The three other tables contain fewer records. The relationships are defined, but now the order of execution is critical. Relationship A is executed first, followed by B, and then C.</p>
              <img alt="" class="internal default" src="http://help.pentaho.com/@api/deki/files/8180/49_execution_of_joins.png?revision=1" />
              <p class="p">Below is the query that is generated:</p>
              <img alt="" class="internal default" src="http://help.pentaho.com/@api/deki/files/8181/50_query_outer_joins.png?revision=1" />
              <p class="p">The nested join syntax that is generated forces the order of execution:</p>
              <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">Join TABLE1 and TABLE2 (shown in red)</li>
                <li class="li">Join TABLE3 and A = B (shown in blue)</li>
                <li class="li">Join TABLE4 with B = Result</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="p">Other orders of execution are just as valid depending on the business context to which they are applied. Another order of execution will generate a different result. To allow business model designers to ensure that user selections are executed
                in a specific way, a <strong class="ph b">Join Order Key</strong>  is added to the <strong class="ph b">Relationship Properties</strong>  dialog box.</p>
              <img alt="" class="internal default" src="http://help.pentaho.com/@api/deki/files/8182/51_relationship_properties_dialog_box.png?revision=1" />
              <p class="p">The join order key is relevant only in instances in which outer joins are deployed in business models. To make the importance of the execution order apparent, this information is displayed in the graphical view of the model.</p>
              <div class="p">
                <p class="pentaho-note">It is not mandatory to use uppercase letters, (A, B, C, as shown in the first image), to set the order in which tables are executed. Any alphanumeric characters (0-9, A-Z) can be used. The system will calculate the ASCII values of each
                  character; the values are then used to determine the order of execution. In the example, A, B, C, AA, AB, Pentaho Metadata Editor will execute the table relationships in the following order: A, AA, AB, B, C.</p>

      <p class="p">To force conditions that would ordinarily be processed in the JOIN condition to be processed in the WHERE clause, follow the directions below to create a <strong class="ph b">delay_outer_join_conditions</strong>  custom property.</p>

      <h2 class="editable">Slow Responses or Inconsistent Results in Reports</h2>
      <p>Your reports may produce slow responses or generate inconsistent results. <span>If a report contains inconsistent or incorrect results, and the SQL command contains several joins, make sure the join order has been specified for that report.</span> </p>
      <p><span>Beginning in version 5.0, inner joins are resolved before outer joins. If you have several tables that require outer joins, the order in which the tables are joined is critical because different join orders produce different results.&nbsp;</span> <span>To make the join order consistent, set the <span class="uicontrol style-wrap">Join Order Key</span>         field in the <span class="uicontrol style-wrap">Relationship Properties</span>  window.

      <p>In version 5.0 of the software, inner joins are resolved before outer joins by default. If you are migrating a report from version 4.8 to 5.x, you can specify which method&nbsp;to use by setting the <span class="filepath style-wrap">legacy_join_order</span>         parameter in the report&rsquo;s <span class="filepath style-wrap">.xmi</span>  file. &nbsp;Set legacy_join_order to <span class="filepath style-wrap"><span class="uicontrol style-wrap">true </span> </span> to use the 4.8 method.&nbsp;Set legacy_join_order
        to <span class="filepath style-wrap">false </span> to use the 5.0 method.</p>
      <p><span>In addition to setting the&nbsp;<span class="filepath style-wrap">legacy_join_order parameter</span>, set the <span class="uicontrol style-wrap">Join Order Key</span>  field in the <span class="uicontrol style-wrap">Relationship Properties</span>         window.</span>
