          <p class="p">Pentaho Report Designer is a sophisticated report creation tool that you can use standalone, or as part of the larger Pentaho Business Analytics suite. It enables professionals to create highly detailed reports based on adequately prepared data
            from virtually any data source. The purpose of this document is to provide instructions for creating a simple Report Designer report.</p>
          <p class="p">This section contains walk-throughs for creating content in Report Designer. You must have Pentaho's sample database installed and available in order to follow the tutorials. Sample data is installed by default with Report Designer, though you
            or your system administrator may have removed it prior to production deployment. If it's been removed, you can simply reinstall Report Designer to get it back.</p>
