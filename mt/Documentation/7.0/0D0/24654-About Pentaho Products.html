    <p>Pentaho products are a comprehensive platform from which you can access, integrate, manipulate, visualize, and analyze your data. Whether data is stored in a flat file, relational database, Hadoop cluster, NoSQL database, analytic database, social
      media streams, operational stores, or in the cloud, the Pentaho products help you discover, analyze, and visualize data to find the answers you need -- even if you have no coding experience. More advanced users can customize reports, queries, transformations,
      or extend functionality using our extensive API if you have programming experience.</p>
