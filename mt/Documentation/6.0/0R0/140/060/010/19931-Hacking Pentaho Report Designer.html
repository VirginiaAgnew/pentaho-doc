        <p class="p">Perhaps you do not need to create a whole new content creation program around the Pentaho Reporting engine; instead, you can enhance or reduce the functionality of Pentaho Report Designer to match your needs.</p>
        <p class="p">Report Designer is both modular and extensible, so you can remove or disable large portions of it, or create your own custom data sources, output formats, formulas, and functions. You can also customize Report Designer with your own background
          images, icons, language, and splash screen.</p>
