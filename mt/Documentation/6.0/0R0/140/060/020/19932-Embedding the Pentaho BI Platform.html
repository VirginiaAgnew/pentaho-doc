        <p class="p">If your Web-based reporting application needs scripting, scheduling, and security functionality, it makes more sense to embed the slightly larger Pentaho BI Platform instead of writing a large amount of your own code to add to the Reporting engine.
          The BI Platform contains powerful scripting and automation capabilities, an email component, report bursting functionality, user authorization and authentication features, and a cron-compatible scheduling framework.</p>
        <p class="p">The BI Platform is the heart of the larger Pentaho BA Server, which is a complete J2EE Web application that provides engines for Pentaho Reporting, Data Integration, and Analysis, as well as a fully customizable Web-based user interface that offers
          interactive reporting, real-time Analyzer views, and interactive dashboard creation.</p>
        <p class="p">The BA Server is fully customizable, so your options range from simple rebranding to removing entire components or developing your own plugins to add major user-facing functionality.</p>
