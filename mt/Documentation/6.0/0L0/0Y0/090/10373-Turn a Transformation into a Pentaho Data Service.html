    <p>Sometimes, building and maintaining a data warehouse is impractical or costly, especially when you need to quickly blend and visualize fast-moving or quickly evolving data sets. &nbsp;Instead of building a data warehouse, you can turn a&nbsp;&nbsp;transformation
      into a&nbsp;Pentaho Data Service&nbsp;that&nbsp;helps you quickly analyze and visualize results from a virtual table. &nbsp; For example, if you want to compare your product prices with your competitors, you could create a Pentaho Data Service that
      blends prices from your in-house data sources and competitor prices from the web.&nbsp; Then, you can use Analyzer to slice, dice, and visualize the results.</p>
    <p>A&nbsp;Pentaho Data Service is a transformation that has been published to the DI Server so it can be queried as a virtual database table.&nbsp; This powerful feature turns an ordinary transformation into a JDBC data source that can be queried with
      simple SQL statements. &nbsp;You can query a Pentaho&nbsp;Data Service&nbsp;from JDBC-compliant tool such as&nbsp;&nbsp;Pentaho Report Designer or Interactive Reporting, as well as compatible non-Pentaho tools like&nbsp;R Studio or SQuirreL.&nbsp;
      The Pentaho Data Service can be the heart of a data blending solution.&nbsp; Use this feature to do these things.</p>
    <ul class="pentaho-list-unordered">
      <li>Connect, combine and transform data from multiple sources,</li>
      <li>Query data directly from any transformation,</li>
      <li>Access architected blends from many JDBC-compliant tools.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Pentaho Data Service is also useful when you have a transformation that yields a large data set, and your users want to see slices of data, on demand. &nbsp; For instance, you could create a data service published to the DI Server that queries
      large research datasets in HDFS or a database.&nbsp; You could then grant access to a smaller group of researchers so they can query the data that is returned by that transformation through the data service.&nbsp; Applying filters to large result
      sets might take a long time, so you can optimize the Pentaho Data Service to push the filter directly to the data source rather than in memory on the DI Server. &nbsp;This means&nbsp;researchers can&nbsp;get a fresh, customized&nbsp;slice of data
      much more quickly than they would with a traditional filter. Researchers can then use Pentaho Interactive Reporting or a tool of their choice, such as R Studio, to further analyze and visualize the results.</p>
    <p>The push down optimization feature is available for data sources connected to from the <strong>Table Input</strong>  and <strong>MongoDB Input </strong> steps.&nbsp; This includes relational database management systems such as Postgres, MySQL, Oracle,
      and MS SQL Server.</p>
    <p>Some SQL limitations apply to the SQL passed to the Pentaho Data Service. See the
