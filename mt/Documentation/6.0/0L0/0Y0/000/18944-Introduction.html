          <p class="p">Pentaho Data Integration (PDI) is a flexible tool that allows you to collect data from disparate sources such as databases, files, and applications, and turn the data into a unified format that is accessible and relevant to end users. PDI provides
            the Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL) engine that facilitates the process of capturing the right data, cleansing the data, and storing the data using a uniform and consistent format.</p>
