        <p class="p">Kettle variables provide a way to store small pieces of information dynamically in a narrower scope than environment variables. A Kettle variable is local to Kettle, and can be scoped down to the job or transformation in which it is set, or up
          to a related job. The <strong class="ph b">Set Variable</strong>  and <strong>Set Session Variables</strong>  steps in a transformation allows you to specify the related job that you want to limit the scope to; for example, the parent job, grandparent
          job, or the root job.</p>
