    <p style="visibility: visible;">You can now make changes to the data model within Analyzer, such as updating the name of a measure or adding a calculated measure to the model. When you save these changes, they become part of the data source for other users to access. We classify
      these types of changes to the data model within Analyzer as <em>inline model editing</em> . Inline model editing allows you to add annotations to the data model, primarily through modifying existing (base) measures or by adding calculated measures
      to a data model. Both of these activities require the 'Manage Data Sources' permission.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>While creating a report in Analyzer, you may want to make changes to a measure to benefit your team, such as renaming a measure to a more familiar name, adjusting the aggregation type to use an average instead of a sum, or modifying how the measure
        will display in the report. For example, if you wanted to rename the measure 'QTY' to 'Quantity', you can leverage inline model editing capabilities rather than opening another tool or submitting an IT request.&nbsp; After you save these changes,
        they now become annotations on the model and will be available to other users who access the data source for reports in Analyzer. For more information on updating measures within Analyzer, see

      <p>When you make updates to measures in Analyzer, these inline model editing changes will be supported by the Streamlined Data Refinery (SDR) process when the model is republished. When creating a data source using the SDR process, from the Build Model
        job entry, select the <strong>Auto Model</strong>  option for the modeling method. For more information, see
        <a title="Build Model (job entry)" rel="internal" href="http://help.pentaho.com/Documentation/6.0/0N0/060/0B0/020/0A0">Build Model Job Entry</a> .</p>

        <strong>Save your calculated measure to the data model</strong> 
      </h3>
      <p>You can save your calculated measure to the data source while creating or editing your report in Analyzer so other users can benefit immediately from your work. For example, while editing a report, you create the calculated measure 'Adjusted Sales'.&nbsp;
        When you add a calculated measure to your 'Market' data source, it now becomes an <em>annotation </em> on the model and it will be available to other users who access 'Market' to create or edit reports in Analyzer. For example, other users can
        see and use the calculated measure you saved to the data model like any other measure. However, since the calculated measure is saved to the data source, it cannot be edited. For more information on creating calculated measures in Analyzer, see
        <a title="Using Calculated Measures in an Analyzer Report" rel="internal" href="http://help.pentaho.com/Documentation/6.0/0L0/120/030/Using_Calculated_Measures_in_an_Analyzer_Report">Using Calculated Measures in an Analyzer Report</a> .</p>
      <p>Calculated measures may also be added to the model in Pentaho Data Integration (PDI) as part of the SDR process. If a PDI developer is updating the transformation which creates the 'Market' model, she can add annotations in the Annotate Stream step,
        including calculated measures. After the SDR job is run, the 'Market' model is published to the Business Analytics (BA) Server and contains the newly added calculated measures which display as measures in Analyzer. For more information on adding
        calculated measures as annotations in a transformation, see
