            or styles of any report elements. </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Click the design element you want to add, then drag it into the report band that you want to add it to, roughly in the position where you want it to appear.</span>  Once the element is placed, it will change from a grey shape
            to a transparent element with an inline label and blue resize handles. </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Click the resize handles and drag them out to the desired dimensions.</span>  </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">If necessary, click the center of the element and drag it to a different location within the layout band.</span>  You cannot drag an element from one band to another. If you want to move something to a different band, you
            must cut and paste it. Dragging an element toward the bottom of the band will increase the size of the band. </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">With the new report element selected, examine the options in the <strong class="ph b">Attributes</strong>  and <strong class="ph b">Style</strong>  panes and make any necessary changes or customizations.</span>  Any changeable
            aspect of a report element can be changed through these two panes. For a complete reference that explains every property of every element, consult the
            <a class="xref" title="Element Attributes Reference" rel="internal" href="http://help.pentaho.com/Documentation/6.0/0L0/130/040/070/000">Element Attributes Reference</a>  and

        <div class="section result">You should now have a properly sized and placed report design element containing the data and options you specified in the Style and Attributes panes. Any of the changes you made in this process can be revisited to further customize the new element.</div>
