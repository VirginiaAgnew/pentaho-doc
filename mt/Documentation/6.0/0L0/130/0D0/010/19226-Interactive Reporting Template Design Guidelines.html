              <p>Interactive Reports are saved as <strong class="ph b">.prpti</strong>  files. Report Designer report files have a <strong class="ph b">.prpt</strong>  extension. In the User Console, Interactive Reports are displayed with a special icon that
                differentiates them from reports that are created in Report Designer.</p>
              <p>If you want to create a new Interactive Reporting template, you must create it in Report Designer and place the template in the Interactive Reporting templates directory.</p>
              <p>For more information about enhancing Interactive Reports and building Interactive Reporting templates in Report Designer, refer to the section

            <p>To create a new Interactive Reporting template, you must use Report Designer to create a report with certain template-specific properties enabled. The resultant PRPT file is then deployed to the IR plugin's template directory.</p>

            <p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">generated-content-marker</strong>  attribute in the <strong class="ph b">wizard</strong>  group is the flag that turns a normal report into a template. This attribute can only be applied to a band (group header, group
              footer, details header, details footer, details, or sub-band).</p>
            <p>RDW will insert its auto-generated content into the first band with the <strong class="ph b">generated-content-marker</strong>  set to true. This applies to the group header, group footer, details header, details footer, and the details bands.
              In the event there are more groups defined in the Report Design Wizard than defined in the template, it repeats the last defined group header and footer in the template.</p>

          <div id="section_3" class="mt-page-section"><span id="Formatting_Inheritance"></span> 
            <h2 class="editable">Formatting Inheritance</h2>
            <p class="p">Formatting styles are inherited, so any formatting applied to a band will also be applied to the elements used within it. Formatting is applied in three ways and in the following order:</p>
            <ol class="pentaho-list-ordered">
              <li class="li">Through the template via band inheritance</li>
              <li class="li">Through query data where it is defined in Pentaho Metadata</li>
              <li class="li">As defined by IR users through the Interactive Reporting interface</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <div id="section_4" class="mt-page-section"><span id="Inheriting_Styles_from_the_Data_Query"></span> 
            <h2 class="editable">Inheriting Styles from the Data Query</h2>
            <p>The <strong class="ph b">query-metadata</strong>  section of the Attributes tab contains options that determine whether formatting styles can come from the data query and be applied to the detail header, details, or detail footer band. This
              must be set directly on the detail header, detail footer, or details band; and the <strong class="ph b">style-format</strong>  option must be set to <strong class="ph b">true</strong>  for it to work. You must also disable any individual formatting
              styles (enable-style-*=true) that you don&rsquo;t want to come from the query.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <div id="section_5" class="mt-page-section"><span id="Padding_and_Grid_Lines"></span> 
            <h2 class="editable">Padding and Grid Lines</h2>
            <p class="p">Since the Details band is dynamically generated, you have to specify grid line and padding settings in the template definition. This is done through the <strong class="ph b">wizard</strong>  attribute group for the band that has the
              <strong
              class="ph b">generated-content-marker</strong>  enabled.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <div id="section_6" class="mt-page-section"><span id="Updating"></span> 
            <h2 class="editable">Updating</h2>
            <p class="p">A template is not just a set of initial defaults for a report -- it is the basis for that report. So if a template is updated, completed reports that were based on that template will also change.</p>
            <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  Report Design Wizard templates have the opposite behavior; when an RDW template is changed, none of the reports based on that template will be automatically be updated with those changes. Instead, you will
              have to edit each report, apply the new template, and save it.</div>
