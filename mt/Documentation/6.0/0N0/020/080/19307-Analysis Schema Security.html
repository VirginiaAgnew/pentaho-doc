        <p class="p">You can restrict portions of your OLAP schema from being viewed by certain user roles defined within your schema definition, and then map those role restrictions to the BA Server so that when you publish the schema, its security restrictions are
          obeyed in Analyzer and Dashboard Designer (or any other BA Server-based dashboard). If you do this, only the permissible parts of the schema will be available to the specified roles. Pentaho offers several unique paths to accomplish role-based
          security, all of which are explained later in this section.</p>
        <p class="p">Refer to the subsections below that apply to your situation.</p>
        <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  Changes to a OLAP schema should be done with Schema Workbench. If you change a schema, you must republish it to the BA Server in order for the modifications to take effect. Changes to XML configuration files
          (such as those that contain core BA Server and Mondrian engine settings or properties) can be done with any text editor.</div>
