      <p class="p">This section helps BA administrators prepare their data for use with the Pentaho Analyzer and Pentaho Report Designer. The collection of analysis components in Pentaho Business Analytics enables you to visualize data trends and reveal useful information
        about your business. You can do this by creating static reports from an analysis data source, traversing an analysis cube through an Analyzer report, showing how data points compare by using charts, and monitoring the status of certain trends
        and thresholds with dashboards.</p>
      <p class="p">Before you can begin using any client tools, you must consolidate data from disparate sources into one canonical source and optimize it for the metrics you want to analyze; create an analysis schema to describe the data; iteratively improve that
        schema so that it meets your users' needs; and create aggregation tables for frequently computed views.</p>
