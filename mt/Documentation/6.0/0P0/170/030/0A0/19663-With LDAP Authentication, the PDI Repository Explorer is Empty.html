          <p class="p">If you log into a solution repository from Spoon before you switch the authentication to LDAP, then the repository IDs and security structures will be broken. You won't see an error message, but the solution repository explorer will be empty
            and you won't be able to create new folders or save PDI content to it. To fix the problem, you will have to delete the security settings established with the previously used authentication method, which will force the DI Server to regenerate
            them for LDAP.</p>
