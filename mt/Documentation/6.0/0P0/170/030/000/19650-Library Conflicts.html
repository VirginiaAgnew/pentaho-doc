        <p class="p">The BA Server relies on many third-party libraries that provide everything from database connectivity to specific Java classes that add necessary features to the BA Server. If you have incompatible versions of any of these third-party libraries
          in your application server's global lib directory, they can cause a variety of problems related to starting and running the BA Server. You will have to discover and individually canonicalize these files according to your needs.</p>
        <p class="p">Some known-problematic JARs are:</p>
        <ul class="ul">
          <li class="li">commons-collections-3.2.jar (from Pentaho)</li>
          <li class="li">commons-collections.jar (from JBoss in <span class="ph filepath">/jboss/server/default/lib/</span> )</li>
          <li class="li">jettison-1.01.jar (from Pentaho)</li>
          <li class="li">jettison.jar (from JBoss in <span class="ph filepath">/jboss/default/deploy/jbossws.sar</span> )</li>
