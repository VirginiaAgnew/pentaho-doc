        <p class="p">If you are using a multi-byte character set, such as would be used for languages like Japanese or Chinese, and find that you have missing or corrupted output when exporting Analyzer reports to PDF, you will have to specify a default TrueType font
          for PDF rendering that supports multi-byte characters. The default PDF font in Analyzer is Helvetica, which does not support multi-byte character sets. To change this setting, see
