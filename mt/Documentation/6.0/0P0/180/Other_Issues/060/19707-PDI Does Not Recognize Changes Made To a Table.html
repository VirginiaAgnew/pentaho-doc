        <p class="p">If PDI does not recognize changes you made to a table, you need to clear the cache of database-related meta information (field names and their types in each used database table). PDI has this cache to increase processing speed.</p>
        <p class="p">If you edit the table layout outside of Spoon, field changes, deletions or additions are not known to PDI. Clearing the cache addresses this issue.</p>
        <p class="p">To clear the database-related meta information cache from within Spoon:</p>
        <p class="p">Select the connection and then <code class="ph codeph">Tools</code> > <code class="ph codeph">Database</code> > <code class="ph codeph">Clear Cache</code>. Or, <code class="ph codeph">Database connections</code> > <code class="ph codeph">Clear complete DB cache</code>.</p>
