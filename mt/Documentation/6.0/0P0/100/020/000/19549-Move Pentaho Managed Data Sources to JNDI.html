        <p class="p">Pentaho provides a Data Source Wizard in the Pentaho User Console that enables business users to develop rapid prototype data sources for interactive reporting and analysis. This is a great way to get off the ground quickly, but they are &quot;quick
          and dirty&quot; and not performant. For maximum performance, you should establish your own JNDI data connections at the Web application server level, and tune them for your database.</p>
        <p class="p">JNDI data sources can be configured for Pentaho client tools by adding connection details to the <span class="ph filepath">~/.pentaho/simple-jndi/default.properties</span>  file on Linux, or the <span class="ph filepath">%userprofile%\.pentaho\simple-jndi\default.properties</span>           file on Windows. </p>
