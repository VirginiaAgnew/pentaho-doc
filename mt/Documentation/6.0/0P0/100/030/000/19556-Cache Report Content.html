        <p class="p">You can cache the result sets of parameterized reports so that every time you change a parameter during your user session (all caching is on a per-session basis) you don't have to retrieve a new result set. By default, Pentaho Reporting has result
          set caching turned on, but you may find some advantage in turning it off or changing the cache thresholds and settings.</p>
        <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  When you publish a report to the BA Server, you switch cache and engine configurations from the local Report Designer versions of <strong class="ph b">ehcache.xml</strong>  and <strong class="ph b">classic-engine.properties</strong>           to the server's version inside the Pentaho WAR. These configurations may not be the same, so if you have made changes to the result set cache settings locally, you may want to port those changes over to the BA Server as well.</div>
