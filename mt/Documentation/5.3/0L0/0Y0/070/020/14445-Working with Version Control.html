        <p class="p">Whenever you save a job or transformation in the DI Repository, you are prompted to provide a comment. Your comments are saved along with your job or transformation so that you can keep track of changes you make. If you have made a change to a
          transformation or job that you do not like, you can choose to restore a specific version of that job or transformation. It is important to provide descriptive version control comments, so that you can make good decisions when reverting to a
          version of a job or transformation.</p>
