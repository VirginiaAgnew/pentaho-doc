        <p class="p">Jobs aggregate up individual pieces of functionality to implement an entire process. Examples of common tasks performed in a job include getting FTP files, checking conditions such as existence of a necessary target database table, running a transformation
          that populates that table, and e-mailing an error log if a transformation fails. The final job outcome might be a nightly warehouse update, for example.</p>

        <p class="p">Jobs are composed of <strong class="ph b">job hops</strong>, <strong class="ph b">job entries</strong>, and <strong class="ph b">job settings</strong> . Hops behave differently when used in a job, see
          <a class="xref" title="Documentation/5.1/0L0/0Y0/040/020"
          rel="internal" href="http://help.pentaho.com/Documentation/5.3/0L0/0Y0/040/020">More About Hops</a> . Job entries are the individual configured pieces as shown in the example above; they are the primary building blocks of a job. In data transformations these individual pieces are called steps. Job entries can provide you
          with a wide range of functionality ranging from executing transformations to getting files from a Web server. A single job entry can be placed multiple times on the canvas; for example, you can take a single job entry such as a transformation
          run and place it on the canvas multiple times using different configurations. Job settings are the options that control the behavior of a job and the method of logging a job&rsquo;s actions. Job file names have a .kjb extension.</p>
