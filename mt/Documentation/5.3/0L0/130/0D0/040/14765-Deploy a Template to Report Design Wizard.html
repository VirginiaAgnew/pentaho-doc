        <ol class="ol steps">
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Shut down Report Designer and Pentaho Data Integration if either of them are currently running.</span>  </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Create an icon for your template, in PNG format, with the same name as the template file.</span>  The size of the icon doesn't matter; RDW will scale it to fit the correct dimensions. However, you can avoid unusual scaling
            issues by creating a square-shaped (equal width and height) graphic. If you'd like further guidance, take a look at the default template icons that Pentaho provides in the templates directory. </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Copy the icon and the PRPT template files to the following directories:</span> 
            <ul class="ul">
              <li class="li">/pentaho/design-tools/report-designer/templates/</li>
