          <p class="p">Once you've created a template for PIR, you must follow the below process to deploy it to the Interactive Reporting plugin.</p>
        </div>
        <ol class="ol steps">
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Shut down the BA Server if it is currently running.</span>  </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Create an icon for your template, in PNG format, with the same name as the template file.</span>  The size of the icon doesn't matter; PIR will scale it to fit the correct dimensions. However, you can avoid unusual scaling
            issues by creating a square-shaped (equal width and height) graphic. If you'd like further guidance, take a look at the default template icons that Pentaho provides in the templates directory. </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Copy the icon and the PRPT template files to the <span class="ph filepath">/pentaho-solutions/system/pentaho-interactive-reporting/resources/templates/</span>  directory.</span> 
          </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Edit the <span class="ph filepath">/pentaho-solutions/system/pentaho-interactive-reporting/resources/messages/messages.properties</span>  file and add a new line for your template with the <strong class="ph b">template_</strong>             prefix, the name of your template file, and a friendly name for the template as you'd like it to appear in the PIR interface, as in the following example (given a template filename of <strong class="ph b">template_demo.prpt</strong> ):</span> 
            <pre class="pre codeblock">template_template_demo=Template Demo</pre> </li>
