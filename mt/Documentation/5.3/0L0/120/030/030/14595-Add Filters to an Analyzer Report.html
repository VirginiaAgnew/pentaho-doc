  <body>
    <div>
      <p class="p">Filters are used to restrict or limit data in a report, building the report to show only the information that you want to view.</p>
      <p class="p">For example, a typical report shows sales by product line. A time filter on Quarter restricts the data so that only sales for the one quarter are shown.</p>
      <p class="p">If you add a regional filter for Europe, the report would display data pertaining to European sales for that quarter. If you add a filter on another field to exclude a product, the report would display data pertaining to European sales in that quarter,
        which are also not a part of the excluded product line.</p>
      <p class="p">Use these steps to add a filter to your Analyzer report.</p>
