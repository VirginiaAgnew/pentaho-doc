        <p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">pg_hba.conf</strong>  file contains host-based authentication information. If you can't run the SQL scripts that generate the Jackrabbit and Quartz databases, it's probably because the default user accounts for each database
          don't have the right permissions. To change this, edit the file to ensure that connections from local users created by the Pentaho sql scripts (such as <strong class="ph b">pentaho_user</strong> ) will be able to connect. The default on Debian-based
          systems is for local connections you use <strong class="ph b">ident</strong>  authentication, which means that database users must have local user accounts. In other words, to continue using <strong class="ph b">ident</strong>, you would have
          to create a local <strong class="ph b">pentaho_user</strong>  account. It's easier to just change the authentication method to something less restrictive, if your IT manager allows that approach.</p>
