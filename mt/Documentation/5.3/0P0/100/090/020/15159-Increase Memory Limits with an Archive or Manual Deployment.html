          <p class="p">By default, Tomcat has a relatively low memory allotment. This can cause out-of-memory errors in the BA Server from time to time. To increase the memory limit, follow the below process.</p>
        </div>
        <ol class="ol steps">
          <li class="li step"><span class="ph cmd">Stop the Tomcat server or service.</span> </li>
          <li class="li step"><span class="ph cmd"><strong class="ph b">Because you are modifying your own Tomcat instance</strong>  and have performed a manual deployment of the BA Server WAR, edit the <span class="ph filepath">~/.bashrc</span>  for the user account that
            starts the Tomcat service, or whatever configuration file or dialogue that contains global system variables on your BA Server machine. Set or modify the <strong class="ph b">CATALINA_OPTS</strong>  system variable to include reasonable minimum
            and maximum memory settings using the <strong class="ph b">-Xms</strong>  and <strong class="ph b">-Xmx</strong>  options. Ensure you customize these settings to fit the needs of your system. </span>  <pre class="pre codeblock">
export CATALINA_OPTS=&quot;-Xms4096m -Xmx6144m&quot; </pre> </li>
          <li class="li step"><span class="ph cmd"><strong class="ph b">If you are using a Pentaho-supplied Tomcat instance</strong>  provided in BA Server archive packages, edit the <strong class="ph b">start-pentaho</strong>  scripts (.bat for Windows, and .sh for Linux), and modify the <strong class="ph b">CATALINA_OPTS</strong>  environment variable, adjusting the values of <strong class="ph b">Xms</strong>  and <strong class="ph b">Xmx</strong>  in the same manner as the previous step.</span>             <pre class="pre codeblock">
export CATALINA_OPTS=&quot;-XMs4096m -Xmx6144m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -

                    -Dsun.rmi.dgc.server.gcInterval=3600000&quot;</pre> </li>
          <li class="li step"><span class="ph cmd">If you are modifying a Windows service for Tomcat, you must use the <strong class="ph b">tomcat6.exe</strong>  command to reconfigure the service parameters within a command line window. You can access Windows Services by going to the <strong class="ph b">Windows Start Menu</strong>  and typing <strong class="ph b">services</strong>  in the <strong class="ph b">Search Programs and Files</strong>  box. See the below example.</span> 
            <p class="p">Windows (this only applies to a Windows service for Tomcat)</p> <pre class="pre codeblock">

          <li class="li step"><span class="ph cmd">Start the Tomcat server or service.</span> </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="section result">Your Tomcat server now has increased minimum and maximum memory limits. You can adjust the <strong class="ph b">JvmMx</strong>  number (this parameter specifies the maximum limit) to a higher number if you prefer. However, if the Java virtual machine
          refuses to start with increased limits, then you will have to add more RAM to your system, stop some memory-intensive services, or reduce the maximum memory limit to a lower number. This problem occurs when there is not enough contiguous memory
          available to assign to the JVM, and appears to happen on Windows at lower thresholds than on other operating systems.</div>
