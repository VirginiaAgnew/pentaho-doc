          <p class="p">After you create a business model you must add the business tables and business columns; then, you create the relationships between your business tables.</p>
          <p class="p">Up to this point, you have used the navigation pane to build the business objects. The workspace on the right side of the page is called the <strong class="ph b">Metadata Editor Graph</strong> . Use the Graph to lay out your business tables and
            show the relationships between them. While you can accomplish the rest of your tasks by manipulating the objects in the navigation pane, you can also use the Graph. </p>

        <ol class="ol steps">
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Right-click <strong class="ph b">Business Tables</strong>  in the navigation pane. Alternatively, you can right-click inside the <strong class="ph b">Metadata Editor Graph</strong>  workspace and select <strong class="ph b">Business Tables</strong> .</span> 
            <div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span>  Drag the physical table from the navigation pane to the Graph workspace to create a new business table based on that physical table. Another shortcut is to drag the physical table in the navigation pane to
              the <strong class="ph b">Business Tables</strong>  node, which will also create a new business table based on that physical table.</div> A list of physical tables, each prefixed by the connection name to which they belong appears. </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Select the physical table you want associated with the new business table.</span>  </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Click <strong class="ph b">OK</strong>  to display the <strong class="ph b">Business Table Properties</strong>  dialog box.</span>

            />
            <p class="p">In the <strong class="ph b">Business Table Properties</strong>  dialog box, the <strong class="ph b">ID</strong>  field is pre-populated with a value. This ID identifies a specific business table, and must be unique. Pentaho recommends that
              you accept the default value for this field.</p>
            <p class="p">The table you chose in Step 3 is listed next, then below the fields is another navigation pane, with the name of your business table and all the columns inherited from the physical table included as business columns. The business columns are
              created for you when the new business table is created, so no need for the extra steps of creating them separately.</p>
