      <div class="abstract abstract glossdef">An alternative to MOLAP (Multidimensional OLAP) technology. While both ROLAP and MOLAP analytic tools are designed to allow analysis of data through the use of a multidimensional data model, ROLAP differs significantly in that it does not require
        the pre-computation and storage of information. Instead, ROLAP tools access the data in a relational database and generate SQL queries to calculate information at the appropriate level when an end user requests it. With ROLAP, it is possible to
        create additional database tables (summary tables or aggregations) which summarize the data at any desired combination of dimensions.</div>
