          <p class="p">CDF dashboards are extremely flexible and work well with Pentaho content, but it takes a good understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop them. This section explains how to view some Pentaho-supplied CDF examples and how to create
            a simple dashboard. </p>
          <p class="p">This document represents the only official, maintained, and up-to-date documentation that Pentaho provides on the Community Dashboard Framework. If you need to purchase further CDF development support, contact your Pentaho account representative.
            You can also purchase more in-depth documentation and examples directly from

              <p class="p">Pentaho ships sample CDF dashboards with the archive package and graphical installer for the BA Server. By default, the samples are not exposed in the solution repository. </p>
              <p class="p">To make them visible, upload the .zip file containing the samples to the BA Server,&nbsp;then edit the <span class="ph filepath">/pentaho-solutions/plugin-samples/</span>  file and set the value of the <span class="ph filepath"><visible></span>                 element to <span class="ph filepath">true</span>, then refresh your solution repository. </p>
              <p class="p">Once you have exposed the samples, you can find the CDF content in the <span class="ph filepath">cdf-samples</span>  directory within <span class="ph filepath">bi-developers</span> . Each example is minimally self-documented; you should examine
                each sample to read the comments in the code and in the rendered dashboard to find out more about how CDF works.</p>
