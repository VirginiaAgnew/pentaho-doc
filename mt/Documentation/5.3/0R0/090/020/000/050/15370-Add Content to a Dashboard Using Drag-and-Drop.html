          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">In the left pane of the Pentaho User Console, under <strong class="ph b">Files</strong>, locate to the content (chart, table, or file) you want added to your dashboard. </span>  </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Click and drag the content into a blank panel on your dashboard. You will see the &quot;title&quot; of the content as you move it around the dashboard. Notice that the title background is red; it turns green when you find a panel where the content can be dropped. </span> 
            <p class="p">Repeat steps 2 and 3 until your dashboard contains all the content you want to display. To swap content from one panel to another, click the title bar of the panel that contains the content you want moved and drag it over the panel you want
              swapped. You will see the swap icon as you are moving the content.</p>
            <p class="p">If you are working with an existing dashboard, you can perform steps 2 and 3 steps; however, a warning message appears when you try to place content in a panel that already contains content. The new content will override the existing content.</p>
