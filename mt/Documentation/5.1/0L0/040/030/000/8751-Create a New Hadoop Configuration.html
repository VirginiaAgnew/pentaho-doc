          <p class="p">If you have a Hadoop distribution not supported by Pentaho, or you have modified your Hadoop Installation in such a way that it is no longer compatible with Pentaho, you may need to create a new Hadoop configuration.</p>
          <p class="p">Changing which version of Hadoop PDI can communicate with requires you to swap the appropriate <span class="ph filepath">jar</span>  files within the plugin directory and then update the <span class="ph filepath">plugin.properties</span>  file.</p>

            property configures which distribution of Hadoop to use when communicating with a Hadoop cluster and must match the name of the folder you created in Step 1. Update this property if you are using a version other than the default Hadoop version.</span>
