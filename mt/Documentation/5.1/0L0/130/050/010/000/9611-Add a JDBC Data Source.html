        <ol class="ol steps">
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Select the <strong class="ph b">Data</strong>  tab in the upper right pane.</span>  By default, Report Designer starts in the <strong class="ph b">Structure</strong>  tab, which shares a pane with <strong class="ph b">Data</strong> .
            </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Click the yellow cylinder icon in the upper left part of the Data pane, or right-click <strong class="ph b">Data Sets</strong> .</span>  A drop-down menu with a list of supported data source types appears. </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Select <strong class="ph b">JDBC</strong>  from the drop-down menu.</span>  The <strong class="ph b">JDBC Data Source</strong>  window appears. </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">If you want to provide parameters that contain different database connection authentication credentials, click the <strong class="ph b">Edit Security</strong>  button in the upper left corner of the window, then type in the fields or variables that contain the user credentials you want to store as a parameter with this connection.</span>             The role, username, and password will be available as a security parameter when you are creating your report. </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Above the <strong class="ph b">Connections</strong>  pane on the left, click the round green <strong class="ph b">+</strong>  icon to add a new data source.</span>  If you installed the Pentaho sample data, several
            <strong
            class="ph b">SampleData</strong>  entries appear in the list. These sample data sources are useless if you do not have the Pentaho HSQLDB sample database installed, so if you don't have that, you can safely delete the SampleData entries. If you do have
              Pentaho's HSQLDB samples installed, it may be advantageous to leave the sample data sources intact in the event that you want to view the sample reports and charts at a later time. </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">In the <strong class="ph b">Database Connection</strong>  dialog, type in a concise but reasonably descriptive name for this connection in the <strong class="ph b">Connection Name</strong>  field; select your database brand from the <strong class="ph b">Connection Type</strong>  list; select the access type in the <strong class="ph b">Access</strong>  list at the bottom; then type in your database connection details into the fields in the <strong class="ph b">Settings</strong>  section on the right.</span>             The Access list changes according to the connection type you select; the settings section will change depending on which item in the access list you choose. </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Click the <strong class="ph b">Test</strong>  button to ensure that the connection settings are correct. If they are not, the ensuing error message should give you some clues as to which settings need to be changed. If the test dialogue says that the connection to the database is OK, then click the <strong class="ph b">OK</strong>  button to complete the data source configuration.</span>             </li>
