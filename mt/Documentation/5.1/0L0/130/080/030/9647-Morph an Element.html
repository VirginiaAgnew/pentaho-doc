          <p class="p">Any data-driven element can be transformed into another type of data-driven element. For instance, if you created and configured a date field and you later realize that it actually needs to be a number field, you can easily change the element
            type with the morph feature by following this process:</p>
        </div>
        <ol class="ol steps">
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Select the element you want to morph.</span>  </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Go to the <strong class="ph b">Format</strong>  menu, then select the <strong class="ph b">Morph</strong>  sub-menu.</span>  </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">In the Morph sub-menu, select the element type you would like to change to.</span>  </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="section result">The element type should now be changed to the one you selected.</div>
