        <p class="p">All aesthetic aspects of all elements can be modified through the Style panel. However, all text-based elements such as text, message, number, and date fields; and labels can be more easily modified through the toolbar just above the report canvas.
          There you will see typical text controls found in nearly every text editor and word processor. These text controls also work for non-textual elements, but the settings will only affect how the element's label appears in the layout bands.</p>
