        <p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">transformation</strong>  is a network of logical tasks called <em class="ph i">steps</em> . Transformations are essentially <em class="ph i">data flows</em> . In the example below, the database developer has created a transformation
          that reads a flat file, filters it, sorts it, and loads it to a relational database table. Suppose the database developer detects an error condition and instead of sending the data to a Dummy step, (which does nothing), the data is logged back
          to a table. The transformation is, in essence, a directed graph of a logical set of data transformation configurations. Transformation file names have a .ktr extension.</p>

        <p class="p">The two main components associated with transformations are <strong class="ph b">steps</strong>  and <strong class="ph b">hops</strong> :</p>
        <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Steps</strong>  are the building blocks of a transformation, for example a text file input or a table output. There are over 140 steps available in Pentaho Data Integration and they are grouped according to function; for example,
          input, output, scripting, and so on. Each step in a transformation is designed to perform a specific task, such as reading data from a flat file, filtering rows, and logging to a database as shown in the example above. Steps can be configured
          to perform the tasks you require.</p>
        <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Hops</strong>  are data pathways that connect steps together and allow schema metadata to pass from one step to another. In the image above, it seems like there is a sequential execution occurring; however, that is not true.
          Hops determine the flow of data <em class="ph i">through</em>  the steps not necessarily the sequence in which they run. When you run a transformation, each step starts up in its own thread and pushes and passes data.</p>
        <div class="p">
          <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  All steps are started and run in parallel so the initialization sequence is not predictable. That is why you cannot, for example, set a variable in a first step and attempt to use that variable in a subsequent
            step.</div>
        </div>
        <p class="p">You can connect steps together, edit steps, and open the step contextual menu by clicking

        <p class="p">A step can have many connections &mdash; some join two steps together, some only serve as an input or output for a step. The data stream flows through steps to the various steps in a transformation. Hops are represented in Spoon as arrows. Hops
          allow data to be passed from step to step, and also determine the direction and flow of data through the steps. If a step sends outputs to more than one step, the data can either be copied to each step or distributed among them.</p>
