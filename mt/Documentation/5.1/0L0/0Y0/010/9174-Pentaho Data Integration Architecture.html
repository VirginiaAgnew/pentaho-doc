            can then be executed locally within Spoon, on a dedicated Data Integration Server, or a cluster of servers.</p>

          <p class="p">Pentaho Data Integration is composed of the following primary components:</p>
          <ul class="ul" id="5937b86d-d705-402b-b7f0-c36daee85cf5__topic_pdi_and_platform__ul_nxd_3rh_5k">
            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Spoon.</strong>  Introduced earlier, Spoon is a desktop application that uses a graphical interface and editor for transformations and jobs. Spoon provides a way for you to create complex ETL jobs without having to read
              or write code. When you think of Pentaho Data Integration as a product, Spoon is what comes to mind because, as a database developer, this is the application on which you will spend most of your time. Any time you author, edit, run or debug
              a transformation or job, you will be using Spoon.</li>
            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Pan.</strong>  A standalone command line process that can be used to execute transformations and jobs you created in Spoon. The data transformation engine Pan reads data from and writes data to various data sources. Pan
              also allows you to manipulate data.</li>
            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Kitchen.</strong>  A standalone command line process that can be used to execute jobs. The program that executes the jobs designed in the Spoon graphical interface, either in XML or in a database repository. Jobs are usually
              scheduled to run in batch mode at regular intervals.</li>
            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Carte</strong> . Carte is a lightweight Web container that allows you to set up a dedicated, remote ETL server. This provides similar remote execution capabilities as the Data Integration Server, but does not provide scheduling,
              security integration, and a content management system.</li>
          </ul>

              <p class="p">If you are new to Pentaho, you may sometimes see or hear Pentaho Data Integration referred to as, &quot;Kettle.&quot; To avoid confusion, all you must know is that Pentaho Data Integration began as an open source project called. &quot;Kettle.&quot;
                The term, K.E.T.T.L.E is a recursive that stands for <strong class="ph b">K</strong> ettle <strong class="ph b">E</strong> xtraction <strong class="ph b">T</strong> ransformation <strong class="ph b">T</strong> ransport <strong class="ph b">L</strong> oad
                <strong class="ph b">E</strong> nvironment. When Pentaho acquired Kettle, the name was changed to <strong class="ph b">Pentaho Data Integration</strong> . Other PDI components such as Spoon, Pan, and Kitchen, have names that were originally
                meant to support a &quot;restaurant&quot; metaphor of ETL offerings.</p>
