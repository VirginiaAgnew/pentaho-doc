      <p class="p">You can limit the number of rows that are displayed in your report. You can also limit the number of seconds a query runs before a timeout occurs. Imposing row limits and timeouts on queries is important to avoid out-of-memory errors, or processes
        that consume too many resources on the database server.</p>
      <p class="p">Both options are available in the <strong class="ph b">Query Setup</strong>  dialog box. In the <strong class="ph b">Data</strong>  tab, click the small icon in the upper-right corner to open the Query Setup dialog box. Make changes as needed and
        close the dialog box when you are done.</p>
