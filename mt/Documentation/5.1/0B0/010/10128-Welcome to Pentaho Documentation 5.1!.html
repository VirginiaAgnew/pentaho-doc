    <p>Welcome to the new Pentaho Documentation Center, powered by MindTouch. The wiki-like authoring environment allows for real-time updates and encourages community collaboration. Users receive up-to-date content since authors can make improvements and
      changes quickly. In addition, registered members can provide feedback on topics, leave comments, and engage with the authors of the content, resulting in immediate and effective updates and changes.</p>

      <p>To make the most of this dynamic documentation center, we encourage you to register on the site. While all users can save an article as a PDF and email article links to colleagues, registered users have the power to provide feedback on articles
        and to leave comments and questions for the authors. Registered users will receive notifications when favorite articles are updated and when questions and comments are addressed. &nbsp;</p>
