          <p class="p">Transforming your data enables you to explore the information about your business and turn it into insight to help you make information-driven decisions. The process is known as Extract, Transform, and Load, or ETL. <strong class="ph b">Extract</strong>             refers to the process of&nbsp; <em class="ph i">reading data</em>  &nbsp;from a source system. <strong class="ph b">Transform</strong>  is the process of&nbsp; <em class="ph i">changing the data</em>  &nbsp;from its original form. <strong class="ph b">Load</strong>             refers the process of&nbsp; <em class="ph i">writing the data</em>  &nbsp;into another target system. Between extracting and loading you can manipulate your data in many ways--such as sorting, aggregating, pivoting, splitting, calculating,
            or validating--so it fits specific needs.</p>

          <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Visually explore your data using Pentaho Analyzer</strong> </p>
          <p class="p">Visualize your data in Instaview with the Analyzer canvas (Pentaho Analyzer), an interactive graphical interface for exploring and visualizing your transformed data. Instaview presents your data multi-dimensionally and enables you to select
            which parts of your data to explore and how to display your analysis.</p>
          <p class="p">When Instaview connects to the specified data source, it analyzes the data to identify measures and dimensions. <strong class="ph b">Measures</strong>  are the quantitative values within your data and are numerical. <strong class="ph b">Dimensions</strong>,
            also called Levels, are categorical labels that identify or provide context to measures within your data. Analyzer Reports can be organized by category and sorted in many ways. You can categorize data alphabetically, by number value, by names
            and categories, and by time. With advanced configuration nearly all of the dimensions and measurements can be configured to fit complex data challenges.</p>
