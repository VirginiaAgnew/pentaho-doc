        <p class="p">You can view dashboards created with the Dashboard Designer. You may want to optimize your dashboards for the mobile environment by selecting layout templates that are better for smaller screen sizes and avoiding Flash charts since the iPad does
          not support Flash. If you choose to view a Flash chart on Pentaho Mobile, it converts to a static image.</p>
