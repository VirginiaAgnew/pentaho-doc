        <p class="p">The middle panel in the <strong class="ph b">Properties</strong>  dialog box is the <strong class="ph b">Properties</strong>  list. This is the list of currently applied metadata properties for the object that is selected in the <strong class="ph b">Subject</strong>           list. The properties are sorted into their appropriate categories for organization. At the top of the Properties list, there are two icons. The

            <div class="p">There are four ways a property can show up in the Property List:
              <ol class="ol">
                <li class="li">The property is a default property for the associated business object, and thus cannot be removed.</li>
                <li class="li">The property was inherited from the business object's physical ancestor. </li>
                <li class="li">The property has been set as part of the self concept.</li>
                <li class="li">The property has been set as part of the object's parent concept. </li>
              </ol>
            </div>
            <p class="p">It may be difficult to set properties without understanding the override hierarchy, so to help make the hierarchy a bit more apparent in the Properties list, the color code alerts you to what concept level is in play.</p>
            <ul class="ul">
              <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Yellow Icon</strong>  = This property is inherited from the object's physical ancestor.</li>
              <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Blue Icon</strong>  = Pentaho set the property on the object's own concept. This could be overriding an inherited property.</li>
              <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Orange Icon</strong>  = This property is set as a result of the parent concept applied to the object.</li>
