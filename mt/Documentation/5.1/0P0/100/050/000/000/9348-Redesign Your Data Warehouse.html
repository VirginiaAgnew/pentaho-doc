        <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  The advice in this section applies to building and optimizing data warehouses in general and is not specific to Analysis. However, since poor data warehouse design is so frequently a significant source of performance
          loss for Pentaho Analysis, it is listed in this section.</div>
        <p class="p">A data warehouse exists to consolidate and partition transactional data into one streamlined, organized, canonical source for reporting and analysis. Some guidelines to follow in data warehouse design are:</p>
        <ul class="ul">
          <li class="li">Be open to modifying the original design to meet adjusted requirements from business users (iterative design).</li>
          <li class="li">Remove data that is not actually used by business users.</li>
          <li class="li">Optimize for the right purpose. There are basically two use cases to consider: analysis (slice/dice/pivot) and static reporting. You could also use a data warehouse to cleanse and consolidate transactional data for data mining, but this model
            would almost certainly be inappropriate for analysis or reporting.</li>
          <li class="li">Avoid creating high-cardinality dimensions (putting too many records into fact tables). High-cardinality dimensions will never perform well.</li>
          <li class="li">If there is a lot of unrelated information in your data warehouse, consider breaking it up into more topic-specific data marts.</li>
          <li class="li">Create indexes for large fact tables.</li>
          <li class="li">Create aggregate tables for frequently-computed views.</li>
        </ul>
