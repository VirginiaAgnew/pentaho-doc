          <p class="p">By default, only users who have the <span class="ph uicontrol">Admin</span>  role can access the Pentaho Operations Mart. The <span class="ph uicontrol">Admin</span>  role has access to all capabilities within all Pentaho products, including the
            Pentaho Operations Mart. If you want to allow users to view and run the Pentaho Operations Mart only, you can assign them the <span class="ph uicontrol">Pentaho Operations</span>  role. For example, a user who has been assigned the <span class="ph uicontrol">Pentaho Operations</span>             user role is able to open and view a report within the DI Operations mart, but does not have the ability to delete it.</p>
          <p class="p">To give users access to view the DI Operations Mart, assign the Pentaho Operations role to those users. </p>
