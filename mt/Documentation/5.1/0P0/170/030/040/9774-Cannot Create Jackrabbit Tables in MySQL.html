        <p class="p">The Pentaho solution repository uses long text strings that require a longer maximum character limit than the default UTF-8 configuration allows. Therefore, if your MySQL character set is configured to use UTF-8, you must change it to
          <strong
          class="ph b">ASCII</strong>  instead in order to use it as a Pentaho solution database. Using UTF-8 will prevent the MySQL initialization scripts from running during installation.</p>
