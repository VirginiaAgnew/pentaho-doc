        <p class="p">The toolbar at the top of the Report Designer window is for file, data, publishing, and cut-and-paste operations. The toolbar makes some of the most frequently used features more accessible to users who have not yet learned keyboard shortcuts
          for them. There are no unique data, publishing, or file operations in the toolbar; every icon represents a feature that is also available through one of the panes or menus in Report Designer.</p>
        <p class="p">To discover what each icon does, mouse over it to see a tooltip description.</p>
