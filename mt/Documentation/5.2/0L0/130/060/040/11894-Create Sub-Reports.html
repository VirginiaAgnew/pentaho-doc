      <p class="p">You can create other reports in your current one by creating sub-reports. This enables you to display data from multiple sources.</p>
      <ol class="ol steps">
        <li class="li step"><span class="ph cmd">Drag and drop a <strong class="ph b">Sub-Report</strong>  element from the Palette to the layout band where you want to display it.</span> </li>
        <li class="li step"><span class="ph cmd">A Sub-Report dialogue will ask if you would like to make this an inline or banded element. Choose one.</span>  Inline Sub-Reports can be placed side-by-side with other elements (even other Sub-Reports). Banded Sub-Reports occupy
          a variable height, but 100% of the report page width, so they cannot be on the same line with other elements.</li>
        <li class="li step"><span class="ph cmd">Double-click the Sub-Report element.</span>  A new report tab will open and capture the window focus.</li>
        <li class="li step"><span class="ph cmd">In the new report tab, establish a data source and create a report as your ordinarily would, keeping in mind that this will be included in the parent report. When you are finished, switch back to the main report tab.</span> </li>
      </ol>
      <p>You should now have a report with a separate data source embedded within your current report. You can repeat this process for as many sub-reports as you have data sources for.</p>
      <p class="pentaho-note">Every master-report and sub-report that you lay out prints its sections in a position related to its original location on paper. So, the position shown on the horizontal line in Report Designer represents the actual position on paper, and the width
        of the sub-report's sections shown represent the actual available width so that you can see
