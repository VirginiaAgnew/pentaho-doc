          <p class="p">The Table of Contents (TOC) feature is similar to a sub-report. It allows you to generate a TOC based on groups you have mapped inside the report or to specify the sub-reports you want included in your TOC. Follow the instructions below to create
            your TOC:</p>
        </div>
        <ol class="ol steps">
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Click and drag the <strong class="ph b">table-of-contents</strong>  icon onto the report canvas. </span>  You are prompted to make the TOC element <strong class="ph b">Inline</strong>  or <strong class="ph b">Banded</strong> .
            Choose one. Inline sub-reports can be placed side-by-side with other elements (even other sub-reports). Banded sub-reports occupy a variable height, but 100% of the report page width, so they cannot be on the same line with other elements.

                field value will be read from the current relational group and in the details-processing, the value will be null. If the <strong class="ph b">group-fields</strong>  list is empty, an automatic mode is activated that collects all groups
