        <p class="p">This section contains walkthroughs for creating content in Report Designer. You must have Pentaho's sample database installed and available in order to follow the tutorials. Sample data is installed by default with Report Designer, though you
          or your system administrator may have removed it prior to production deployment. If it's been removed, you can simply reinstall Report Designer to get it back.</p>
