        <ol class="ol steps">
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Select your data source in the <strong class="ph b">Connections</strong>  pane on the left, then click the round green <strong class="ph b">+</strong>  icon above the <strong class="ph b">Available Queries</strong>  pane on the right (this is the + button in the upper right corner of the window).</span>             </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Type a concise yet sufficiently descriptive name for this query in the <strong class="ph b">Query Name</strong>  field.</span>  </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Click the pencil icon above the upper right corner of the <strong class="ph b">Query</strong>  field.</span>  The SQL Query Designer tool will come up. </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">In the lower left pane, click to select the first table you want to select data from, then double-click it to move it to the query workspace.</span>  The table you selected will appear in the blue workspace as a sub-window
            containing all of the table's rows. </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Check all of the rows you want to include in the query.</span>  By default, all rows are selected. If you only want to select a few rows (or a single row), click the table name at the top of the sub-window, then click
            <strong
            class="ph b">deselect all</strong>  in the popup menu, then check only the rows you want to include in your query. </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Repeat the previous step for other tables you want to work with.</span>  </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">You can create an SQL JOIN between tables by selecting a reference key in one table, then dragging it to the appropriate row in another table. To modify the JOIN, right-click its red square, then click <strong class="ph b">edit</strong>  in the popup menu.</span>             </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">To add a condition or expression, right-click a row in the query workspace, and select the appropriate action from the context menu.</span>  </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">To order or group by a particular row, drag a statement from the <strong class="ph b">SELECT</strong>  category in the upper left pane down to the <strong class="ph b">GROUP BY</strong>  or <strong class="ph b">ORDER BY</strong>  categories.</span>             </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">To edit the SQL syntax directly, click the <strong class="ph b">syntax</strong>  tab in the bottom left corner of the SQL Query Designer window.</span>  </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Click <strong class="ph b">Preview</strong>  to view the unformatted query results; click <strong class="ph b">OK</strong>  to finish working on the query.</span>  </li>
