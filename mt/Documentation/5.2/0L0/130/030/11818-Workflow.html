      <p class="p">To create a report in Report Designer, follow this process.</p>
      <ol class="pentaho-list-ordered">
        <li class="li">Connect to a data source (database, usually, though you can also pull data from a flat file)</li>
        <li class="li">Constrain the data with a query</li>
        <li class="li">Arrange data elements in the Report Designer workspace</li>
        <li class="li">Apply formatting and add extra graphical elements</li>
        <li class="li">Create formulas or calculated fields using data retrieved from your query</li>
        <li class="li">Publish the report, either to the Pentaho BA Server, or locally as a PDF or other supported file format</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="p">Your report will consist mostly of data retrieved from a database query that you will create through Report Design Wizard, SQL Query Designer, MQL Query Builder, or by hand. Once you have a dataset, you are able to further constrain it to show specific
        details, and then move on to report layout and design.</p>
