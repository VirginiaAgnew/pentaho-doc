          <p class="p">Creating Interactive reports is easy to do from the <span class="ph uicontrol">Home</span>  page of the <span class="ph uicontrol">User Console</span> . Interactive reports are built by clicking and dragging fields from your data source and on
            to a report canvas. You can see the report take shape as you drag fields to the canvas, and you can change the layout and format of the report as you go along.</p>
          <p class="p">These steps guide you through making an Interactive report.</p>
