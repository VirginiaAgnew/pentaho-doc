          <p class="p">You can create filters on multiple groups of fields, rather than a single group of fields. Filters with multiple groups are called advanced filters. To create an advanced filter, drag the fields into the <strong class="ph b">Filter Panel</strong>             and move items into multiple groups by moving them up, down, and indenting them to create a hierarchy.</p>
