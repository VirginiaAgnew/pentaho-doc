        <p class="p">When you disable the <strong class="ph b">Auto Refresh </strong>  mode in Interactive Report you can design your report layout first, including calculations and filtering, without querying the database until you are done. When the report layout
          is complete, you can re-enable Auto Refresh mode. Data retrieval occurs once, and your report displays the requested data. Disable auto refresh if you want to reduce the number of queries executed against the data source, or if you know that
          the data source returns data slowly.</p>
        <p class="p">To disable Auto Refresh, click the small icon in the upper-right corner of the <strong class="ph b">Data</strong>  tab to open the Query Setup dialog box, then disable the <strong class="ph b">Auto Refresh</strong>  option.</p>
