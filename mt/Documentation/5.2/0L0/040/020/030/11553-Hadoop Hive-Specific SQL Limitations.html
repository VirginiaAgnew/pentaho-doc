        <p class="p">There are a few key limitations in Hive that prevent some regular Metadata Editor features from working as intended, and limit the structure of your SQL queries in Report Designer:</p>
        <ul class="ul">
          <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Outer joins are not supported</strong> .</li>
          <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Each column can only be used once in a SELECT clause</strong> . Duplicate columns in SELECT statements cause errors.</li>
          <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Conditional joins can only use the = conditional unless you use a WHERE clause</strong> . Any non-equal conditional in a FROM statement forces the Metadata Editor to use a cartesian join and a WHERE clause conditional to
            limit it. This is not much of a limitation, but it may seem unusual to experienced Metadata Editor users who are accustomed to working with SQL databases.</li>
