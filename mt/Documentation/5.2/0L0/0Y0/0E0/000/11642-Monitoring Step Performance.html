        <p class="p">Pentaho Data Integration provides you with a tool for tracking the performance of individual steps in a transformation. By helping you identify the slowest step in the transformation, you can fine-tune and enhance the performance of your transformations.</p>
        <p class="p">You enable the step performance monitoring in the <strong class="ph b">Transformation Properties</strong>  dialog box. To access the dialog box right-click in the workspace that is displaying your transformation and choose, <strong class="ph b">Transformation Settings</strong> .
          You can also access this dialog box, by pressing
          <<strong class="ph b">CTRL + T</strong> >.</p>

        <p class="p">As shown in the sample screen capture above, the option to track performance (<strong class="ph b">Enable step performance monitoring?</strong> ) is not selected by default. Step performance monitoring may cause memory consumption problems in long-running
          transformations. By default, a performance snapshot is taken for all the running steps every second. This is not a CPU-intensive operation and, in most instances, does not negatively impact performance unless you have many steps in a transformation
          or you take a lot of snapshots (several per second, for example). You can control the number of snapshots in memory by changing the default value next to <strong class="ph b">Maximum number of snapshots in memory</strong> . In addition, if you
          run in Spoon locally you may consume a fair amount of CPU power when you update the JFreeChart graphics under the Performance tab. Running in &quot;headless&quot; mode (Kitchen, Pan, DI Server (slave server), Carte, Pentaho BI platform, and
          so on) does not have this drawback and should provide you with accurate performance statistics.</p>
