        <p class="p">Reading rows and updating rows on a table, within a single transformation, can cause the database to stop updating, referred to as locking, or slow down processing speeds.</p>
        <p class="p">Reading rows and updating rows in the same transformation on the same table should be avoided when possible as it is often causes these issues.</p>
        <p class="p">A general solution compatible with all databases is to duplicate the table to be read/updated, then create separate read/update steps. Arrange the steps to be executed sequentially within the transformation, each on a different, yet identical,
          version of the same table.</p>
        <p class="p">Adjusting database row locking parameters or mechanisms will also address this issue.</p>
