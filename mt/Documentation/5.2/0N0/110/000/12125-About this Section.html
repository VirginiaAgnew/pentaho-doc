      <p class="p">This section provides you with information and instructions to help you use the <strong class="ph b">Pentaho Metadata Editor</strong>, a tool that allows you to build metadata models and domains. There is also an exercise included that walks you
        through creating a metadata model using a small sample database.</p>
      <p class="p">There is sample data available if you want to test Metadata Editor before importing your own data. This sample data is inside of the Pentaho download. This process will be covered later in this section.</p>
