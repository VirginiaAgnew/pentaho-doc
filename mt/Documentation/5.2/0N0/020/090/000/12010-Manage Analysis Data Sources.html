        <p class="p">In order to use a properly prepared data source with Pentaho Analysis, it must be established in either the User Console as a Native (JDBC) data source, or in your Web application server as a JNDI data source. Whichever method you choose, you
          will have to know the name of the data source later on when you're asked to supply it in Pentaho Schema Workbench.</p>
        <p class="p">Schema Workbench can only work with one data source for each Mondrian schema; this is a structural limitation in the software that will be remedied at a later time. You can have multiple JNDI or Native (JDBC) data sources established, but only
          one at a time can be used with Schema Workbench.</p>
