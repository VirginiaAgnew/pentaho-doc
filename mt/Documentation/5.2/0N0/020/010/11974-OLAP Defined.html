      <p class="p">Pentaho Analysis is built on the Mondrian online analytical processing (<strong class="ph b">OLAP</strong> ) engine. OLAP relies on a multidimensional data model that, when queried, returns a dataset that resembles a grid. The rows and columns that
        describe and bring meaning to the data in that grid are <strong class="ph b">dimensions</strong>, and the hard numerical values in each cell are the <strong class="ph b">measures</strong>  or <strong class="ph b">facts</strong> . In Pentaho Analyzer,
        dimensions are shown in yellow and measures are in blue.</p>
      <p class="p">OLAP requires a properly prepared data source in the form of a star or snowflake schema that defines a logical multi-dimensional database and maps it to a physical database model. Once you have your initial data structure in place, you must design
        a descriptive layer for it in the form of a Mondrian schema, which consists of one or more cubes, hierarchies, and members. Only when you have a tested and optimized Mondrian schema is your data prepared on a basic level for end-user tools like
        Pentaho Analyzer. See
