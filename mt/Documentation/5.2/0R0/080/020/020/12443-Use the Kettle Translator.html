          <div class="note warning"><span class="warningtitle">Warning:</span>  This procedure involves downloading and compiling source code. The program you build will not be covered by standard Pentaho support agreements. If you want to translate message bundles without compiling
            from source, you can simply search for messages_en_US.properties files within the data-integration-client directory (including all of the JARs therein), as explained in
            <a class="xref" title="Documentation/5.1/080/020/010" rel="internal" href="http://help.pentaho.com/Documentation/5.2/0R0/080/020/010">Design Tool Localization</a> . Properties files can be inserted into JARs without invalidating your support agreement; you can also override those JARs with directories in the PDI classpath.</div>
          <p class="p">Pentaho Data Integration has thousands of translatable strings. Because there are so many, and the number of strings increases with each new step and entry, Pentaho provides a graphical translation tool to make the process easier.</p>
          <p class="p">Before commencing a translation project, check to make sure the target language isn't already available. PDI already has complete or partially-complete translations for the following locales:</p>
          <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li">en_US</li>
            <li class="li">it_IT</li>
            <li class="li">fr_FR</li>
            <li class="li">ja_JP</li>
            <li class="li">es_AR</li>
            <li class="li">ko_KR</li>
            <li class="li">zh_CN</li>
            <li class="li">de_DE</li>
            <li class="li">es_ES</li>
            <li class="li">pt_BR</li>
            <li class="li">nl_NL</li>
            <li class="li">pt_PT</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="p">Additionally, there are certain translation rules and guidelines for some languages. You may need to search for the current rules and guidelines for the language you are using.</p>
          <p class="p">To use the translation tool, follow the below directions.</p>

            and red packages have more than 50 keys that are missing translations for the selected locale. Once you select a package, the translatable keys list will populate.</li>
