          <p class="p">Pentaho software engineers have anticipated that you may want to develop custom plugins to extend Pentaho Data Integration (PDI) functionality or to embed the PDI engine into you own Java applications. To aid experienced Java developers, we
            provide Java classes and methods, as well as sample Eclipse-based projects with detailed code-level documentation. The instructions in this publication show you how to approach your plugin project. When reading the instructions, we recommended
            that you open the related sample project and follow along.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="p">Unless specifically stated otherwise, developing custom plugins and extending or embedding PDI is not covered under the standard Pentaho customer support agreement.</p>

            <p class="p">When beginning a new PDI-related project we recommend you start from one of the sample projects and adapt it to your development environment.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="p">The sample projects come preconfigured as Eclipse projects, complete with dependencies to a stable release of PDI.&nbsp;If you are developing for a specific version of PDI, you must replace the dependency <span class="ph filepath">jar</span>               files to match your version of PDI. The PDI classes and methods are stable for any major version of PDI, so you can safely replace the <span class="ph filepath">jar</span>  files and develop for any PDI 5.x release.</p>

            <h2 class="editable">Getting PDI Sources</h2>
            <p class="p">When developing with PDI, also known as the Kettle project to the open source community, it is helpful to have the Kettle sources close by. Including them in development projects makes it possible to trace and step through core PDI code, which
              helps when debugging your solution.&nbsp;</p>
            <div class="p">
              <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  It is not necessary or supported to modify or compile any of the PDI sources when embedding or extending PDI. Including the PDI sources in your projects is optional.</div>

            <p class="p">PDI follows the standard project layout for GitHub repositories. The version currently in development is hosted in the trunk folder, patch branches are hosted in the branch folders, and released versions are tagged in the tags folder.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="p">If you are developing for a specific version of PDI, for instance 5.2.0 , it is important to check-out or export the corresponding tag. To check which version you need to match your installation, select <span class="ph uicontrol">Help</span>               > <span class="ph uicontrol">About</span>  from the Spoon menu.</p>

              allows you to trace into PDI core code.</p>
