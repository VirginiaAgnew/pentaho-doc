      <p class="p">This section is designed to help you discover where your BA Server performance bottlenecks are, along with instructions and suggestions on how to address them.</p>
      <p class="p">There are many ways to improve the speed and efficiency of Pentaho software documented here. Each applies to a specific situation and <strong class="ph b">should never be blindly applied</strong> . Some of the performance tweaks herein will remove
        functionality and in some cases security from your BA Server instance. Others will assign more system resources to the BA Server, which could in turn impact other services running on the same machine.</p>
      <p class="p">To put it more plainly: <strong class="ph b">Performance always comes at the cost of one or more of: functionality, security, or resources.</strong> </p>
      <p class="p">The tips and tricks listed here are meant as an initial set of self-service tasks for improving Pentaho Business Analytics performance. There are much more advanced techniques that may improve performance, but require code changes or major surgical
        changes to Pentaho software, none of which should ever be attempted without qualified assistance. These techniques are not included in this section for safety reasons. A Pentaho partner or consultant can assist you with more advanced performance
        improvements, if required.</p>
