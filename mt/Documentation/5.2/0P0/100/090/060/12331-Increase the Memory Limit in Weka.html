          <p class="p">Weka uses the memory settings passed to it from the Java command line or the script that invokes it. If you're experiencing an OutOfMemory exception, you must increase the amount of heap space available to Weka by changing the Java options that
            set memory allocation. Follow the directions below to accomplish this.</p>
          <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  In the examples below, the memory size notations are <strong class="ph b">m</strong>  for megabytes and <strong class="ph b">g</strong>  for gigabytes. You can use whichever is most appropriate for your situation.</div>
        </div>
        <ol class="ol steps">
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Exit Weka if it is currently running.</span>  </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">If you are running Weka standalone from the command line, modify your Java command to include an <strong class="ph b">-Xmx</strong>  line that specifies a large upper memory limit.</span>  <pre class="pre codeblock">java -Xmx2g weka.jar</pre>            </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">If you are running Weka as part of a script, change your Java invocation so that it includes the above <strong class="ph b">-Xmx</strong>  setting.</span>  </li>
          <li class="li step"> <span class="ph cmd">Start Weka and ensure that there are no memory-related exceptions.</span>  </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="section result">The Java virtual machine instance that Weka uses now has access to more heap space, which should solve OutOfMemory exceptions and increase performance.</div>
