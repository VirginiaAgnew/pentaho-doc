          <p class="p">You can edit the data integration transformation for an Instaview by clicking <span class="ph uicontrol">Edit</span>  within the <span class="ph uicontrol">Data Integration </span> panel.</p>
          <p class="p">Changing how your data is transformed should be done by a data designer. Configuring a transformation incorrectly would limit your ability to create Analyzer Reports. If you do not have experience with ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), you should
            use caution when directly editing the data integration transformation. Pentaho Data Integration is a powerful ETL tool and can be approached by even a novice data designer with the help of some additional resources.</p>
          <p class="p">Once selected, editing the data integration transformation is done within the Pentaho Data Integration Spoon interface from the <span class="ph uicontrol">Data Integration</span>  perspective.</p>
          <p class="p">Using Pentaho Data Integration perspectives allows you to change how you connect to data, the connection data type to connect to or how that data is transformed. The <span class="ph uicontrol">Data Integration</span>  perspective is a powerful
            ETL tool with drag-and-drop capabilities which enable users to manage their data.</p>
