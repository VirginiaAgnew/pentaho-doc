        <p>In addition to the installation steps, the update process uses a set of backup and recovery scripts to aid in the backup, recovery, and transfer of your system&rsquo;s existing configuration files. We recommend that you read through this entire
          document before you perform the installation steps.&nbsp; Becoming familiar with the entire update process allows you to create a strategy which can increase your likelihood of a successful update experience.</p>
        <p>We recommend that you initially perform this update in a development test environment before upgrading your production environment. To minimize the impact to your day-to-day operations, we suggest that you perform this update during off-business
          hours. If you need assistance, contact Technical Support. If you need help tailoring the update process for your environment, contact Concierge or Consulting Services.</p>

        <p>You must have a user ID with administrator privileges to install this update. For Linux, log on as the user who installed the system to successfully complete some tasks. It is recommended that you create a user account named 'pentaho' on the server
          computer for installation tasks. For Windows, log on as a user with administrator privileges to complete installation tasks. This link provides you with more information on creating a user account for installation tasks.</p>

        <p>To avoid any issue with the operating system file permissions, log on to the operating system of the server machine as the user who installed your current version of Pentaho, such as &lsquo;pentaho&rsquo;, in Linux or as the Administrator user
          in Windows.</p>
